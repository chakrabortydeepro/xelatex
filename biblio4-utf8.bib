Specifically it deals with the cultural construct of "Kerala ayurveda", and the modes of its societal reproduction and recreation simultaneously as culture and as medicine in cosmopolitan Mumbai. Through an analysis of the historical and cultural roots of Kerala ayurveda and the role of community organisations in its translocation into a city, the paper shows the analytical fragility of the tradition/modern binary in the understanding of contemporary indigenous systems and questions the belief that state and market provide the foremost sites for institutional and secular practice of indigenous medicines.},

It was written by YD, son of the famous GD, minister of the Tanjore Nāyaka rulers Achyta and Raghunātha." In sarga 1, GD is said to be a great authority in Advaita Vedanta and in the six darśanas (p.274): \emph{advaitavidyāvibhavāvalambān govindayajvendragurūn upāse /\\ nirmathya ṣaḍdarśananīradhīnye dhiyaiva sārān dadate budhebhyaḥ} \\ p.270: at end of sarga III, Raghunātha is said to be supporting 1000 Brahman families at Champakāṭavi (Mannarguḍi). After R. was born and educated in sāhitya (arts), he was directed by his father to compose a poem dealing with the life of Krishna, since by literary works alone could one become immortal (p.276:)\emph{rāmo daśasv avatareṣv api rājate 'sāv\\// adyāpi kīrtivapur ādikaver nibandhāt// tasmād vidhehi samatām adadhehi tāvad // yatnaṃ vibhor yad upateś caritaprabandham//27//}. \\ About a dozen works in Sanskrit and Telugu ascribed to R. have survived. His Telugu poem Rāmāyanam ``is highly praised for its merits, and it has been translated into Sanskrit by Madhuravāṇi , another poetess that adorned his court. R. helped the king of Jaffna (Yāḷpāṇa -> N\=epāḷa) to protect himself against the Portuguese (pārasīkas). \\ p.271: Sarga IX when autumn arrived, King Acyuta remembered the promise he had made to the king of Jaffna and held a council with his minister Govinda Dīkṣita and his son Raghunātha in the palace Lakshmīvilāsam. \\ Sarga X: A, R, and GD hold council. GD described theaggressions of the Portuguese upon the Jaffna king. He then proceeded to give an account of Cholaka (Śoḍ{l}aga) their allay. a cruel torturer and murderer who had occupied an island near the coast and was helping the Portuguese. (p.272) GD then sayd that the king of the Pāṇdya (Nāyaka of Madura) was hostile to him, and had allied with Śoḷaga and the Nāyaka of Gingī, Krishnappa.

  abstract  = {Rashid al-Din (1274-1318), physician and powerful minister at the court of the Ilkhans, was a key figure in the cosmopolitan milieu in Iran under Mongol rule. He set up an area in the vicinity of the court where philosophers, doctors, astronomers, and historians from different parts of Eurasia lived together, exchanged ideas and produced books. He was himself involved in collecting, collating and editing these materials, and the substantial oeuvre that resulted is a gold-mine for anyone studying the transmission of knowledge across cultures. By bringing together contributions from the fields of the history of religion, medicine, science and art, this book examines the cultural dynamics of Rashid al-Din’s circle. It addresses questions such as: How were different or conflicting perceptions mediated? What were Rashid al-Din’s aims in gathering information about different religions and societies? To what extent does Rashid al-Din’s intellectual contribution represent something new and different from its individual components?},

This seems to be due to the fact that Sanskrit scholarship suffered considerably during this period by the flight of some scholarly families and the persecution of those [p.38] that remained behind.\footnote{Statements like {\dn sa.mpraapte tu kalau kaale vindhyaadreruttare sthitaa.h| braahma.naa yaj~narahitaa jyoti.h"saastraparaa"nmukhaa.h| vindhyasya dak.si.ne bhaage yatra godaavarii nadii| tatra vedaa"s ca yaj~na"s ca bhavi.syanti kalau yuge||} that occur in Smṛtis like Vyāsa are obviously inspired by the actual observation of the condition of Sanskrit scholarship in places like Benares during 1200--1500 A.D.} Gone for Benares were the days when royal patronage used to offer a powerful incentive to the cause of learning and scholarship. Bernier, who visited Benares by the middle of the 17th century, has observed that Benares students were no doubt studying for ten or twelve years, but could entertain no hopes whatever that honour and emoluments might be the reward of extraordinary attainments.\footnote{Bernier, \emph{Travels in the Mogul Empire}, p.334.} In spite of this, however, Benares scholars soon adjusted themselves to the new circumstances, and we find the lamp of Sanskrit learning burning luminously at Benares from the 16th century. \footnote{The Deccan itself had passed under the Muslim rule in the 14th century, and so the exodus to the south must have come to an end. During the period 1200--1400 A.D., the lamp of Sanskrit learning was burning at Benares, but burning very dimly.} Benares once more became the foremost place of Hindu religion and Sanskrit learning in spite of its Muslim Government. It once more began to attract scholars from the farthest corners of India, who were held in the highest veneration on their return home at the completion of their education. Several learned families of Maharashtra and Karnatik came and settled down permanently at Benares by the beginning of the 16th century. Dharmādhikāri, Śeṣa, Bhaṭṭa and Mouni were the chief among them. Members of these families and their disciples dominated Benares scholarship for more than three centuries.\footnote{I am indebted to Pandit Narayana Shastri Khiste, Librarian, Manuscript Library, Queen's College, Benares, for some of the information given in this section.} Nanda Pandit, the famous author of \emph{Dattaka-mīmāmsā}, (c. 1570--1630 A.D.) was a member of the Dharmādhikāri family, which had migrated to Benares [p.40] from Bidar by the beginning of the 126th century A.D.\footnote{This family possesses a copy of a \emph{tāmrapaṭṭa}, said to have been issued by King Anaṅgapāla in the 11th century A.D., conferring upon the Deccan Brahmins the right of \emph{paurohitya} over Benares, Prayāga and Gayā. The original of this copy is not available, and its genuineness is doubtful as king Ana\.gapāla is not known to have been ruling over these cities in the 11th century A.D.} \emph{Paraśurāma-prakāśa} is another work on Dharmaśāstra, written by Khaṇḍerāya, another member of this family probably in the same century. The Śeṣa family, which also came to Benares by the beginning of the 16th century,\footnote{For a detailed history of the Śeṣa and Bhaṭṭa families, see \emph{Ind. Ant.} Vol. XLI, pp. 245--253 and pp. 7--15. Both families came to Benares from the bank of the Godāvarī river; the precise places are not known.} has made important contributions to several branches of Sanskrit literature.\footnote{Of these seven were on Sanskrit and Prakrit gram{3}, viz., \emph{Upapadamatiṅ-sūtravyākhyāna, Padacandrikā, Prakriyāprakāśā} [\emph{sic}], \emph{Prākṛtacandrikā, Yaṅlugantaśiromaṇi, Śabdālaṅkāra and Sphoṭatatva}, three on Kāvya, viz., \emph{Kaṃsavadha, Pārijātaharaṇacampū, Murārivijayarmaśāstra}, viz., \emph{Śūdrācāraśiromaṇi}.} His brother Cintāmaṇi also composed several works, \emph{Rasamanjarī-parimala} being a noteworthy one amongst them. Vīreśvara, a son of Kṛṣṇa, has not left behind any works, but he was the preceptor of three distinguished disciples, who have made very important contributions to different branches of Sanskrit literature. The first among them was Jagannātha Paṇḍitarāja,\footnote{This title is still exclusively used to denote Jagannātha by modern Pandits.} the author of \emph{Rasagaṅgādhara, Manoramākucamardanam} and several other Sanskrit works.\footnote{Among his works may be mentioned \emph{Amṛtalaharī, Karuṇālahari, Citramīmānsākhandanaṁ, Pīyūṣalaharī Bhāminīvilāsa, Lakṣmīlaharī, Sudhālaharī}, and \emph{Asafavilāsa}.} The second was Bhaṭṭojī Dīkṣita, the famous author of \emph{Siddhāntakaumudī}, which is [p.41] still studied in every Sanskrit \emph{Pāṭhaśālā}. The third was Annambhaṭṭa, the author of \emph{Tarkasaṅgraha}. All these scholars were prolific writers and flourished in the 17th century. The Bhaṭṭa family, which immigrated to Benares in the 16th century, also made important contribution to Sanskrit literature. Bhaṭṭa Nārāyaṇa, who flourished in the latter half of the 16th century, was the author of several works, \emph{Prayoga-ratna} and \emph{Tristhalīsetu} being the chief ones among them. He re-erected the temple of Viśvanātha in c. 1585 on its old site. He was given the title of \emph{Jagadguru}, `the preceptor of the universe', and he exercised profound influence over later writers. His son \'Saṅkarabhaṭṭa wrote \emph{Dvaitanirṇaya, Vratamayūkha} and \emph{Gādhivaṁśānucaritakāvya}. The last work is a history of the family, its \emph{gotra} being Viśvāmitra. Śaṅkarabhaṭṭa's son was Nīlakaṇṭha. He belonged to the first half of the 17th century and composed \emph{Bhagavantabhāskara} consisting of twelve \emph{Mayūkhas}, each dealing with a different topic of Dharmaśāstra. Nīlakaṇṭhas's cousin, Kamalākarabhaṭṭa, is the author of \emph{Nirṇayasindu}, a book on Dharmaśāstra, most frequently consulted by modern Pandits.\footnote{Kamalākara was a grandson of Nārāyaṇa and a son of Rāmakṛṣṇa.} Raghunātha, another member of this family, has composed \emph{Kālatatvavivecana} and \emph{Gotrapravaranirṇaya}. Viśvesvarabhatṭṭa, alias Gāgābhaṭṭa, who was invited by Sivaji to Raigad on the occasion of his coronation, was also a member of the Bhaṭṭa family. He was an erudite scholar and voluminous writer and his declaration that Sivaji was a full-ledged Kṣatriya showed that he was a man of vision not bound down by traditional views. He has composed a few works on Mīmāmsā and more than a dozen books on Dharmaśāstra.\footnote{Among his works the following may be mentioned here: \emph{Kāyasthadharmadīpa, Prayogasāra, Sapiṇḍavicāra, Mīmāmsākusumāñjalī, Rākāgama} on poetics and thirteen \emph{Nibandhas} on Dharmaśāstra topics known as \emph{uddyotas}. These latter were commenced by his father, Dinakara and completed by Gāgābhaṭṭa.} Among other authors of the 17th century may be mentioned Raṅgojī dīkṣita, a brother of Bhaṭṭoji Dīkṣita, [p.42] who has composed \emph{Advaitacintāmaṇi} and \emph{Advaitaśāstrsāroddhāra}. He is known by the title \emph{Dvaitaśāstraśatru}. His son Koṇḍabhaṭṭa was a famous grammarian, his work \emph{Vaiyākaraṇabhūṣaṇa} being at present prescribed in several Sanskrit colleges. Among the eighteenth century celebrities of Benares may be mentioned Nāgojībhaṭṭa Kāle, the author of several works on Dharmaśāstra, Mīmāmsā and Sāhitya, and his pupil Vaidyanātha Pāyaguṇ\d de, who wrote commentaries on almost all the works of his preceptor. Vaidyanātha's wife Lakṣmiībai is the reputed author of erudite commentaries on the \emph{Mitākṣarī} and the \emph{Kālanirṇaya}.\footnote{Lakṣmī's authorship of these commentaries is extremely doubtful. The introduction and colophon no doubt definitely ascribe the work to Lakṣmī, but the evidence of style and the reference to Nagojībhaṭṭa as the \emph{preceptor} of the author show that Vaidyanātha himself was the author of the work. Nāgojībhaṭṭa was the \emph{teacher} of Vaidyanātha and not of Lakṣmī. } The contributions of Benares to Vedānta during the period was not negligible. In the 16th century Nārasimhāśrama composed \emph{Advaitadīpikā} and \emph{Tatvaviveka}. During the next century two famous works were composed in Benares on Vedānta, \emph{Aṇubhāṣya} and \emp{Advaitasiddhi}. The former was composed at Benares by Vallabhācārya, the founder of the Śuddhādvaita school, who spent the evening of his lie at Benares, where he died at Hanuman ghat. \emph{Advaitasiddhi}, which is one of the most erudite, ingenious and difficult works on Advaita Vedānta, was composed here by Madhusūdana Sarasvatī. The works on Advaita of Raṅgojībhaṭṭa have been mentioned already. In the sphere of Nyāya the contribution of Benares was not considerable. Nadia was a more celebrated centre of Nyāya scholarship than Benares. Bhavadeva Siddhāntavāgīśa\footnote{This scholar has written several commentaries on Nyāya works.} [p.43] and his pupil Mahādevaśāstrī Puntambekar\footnote{\emph{Nyāyakaustubha}, written by this scholar, has been published in the Sarasvatībhavana series.} are the principal Nyāya authors of Benares; they flourished in the 1th century. Contribution of Benares to Sanskrit scholarship and literature during the period 1500--1800 A. D. is undoubtedly much greater than that of any other three contemporary centre of Sanskrit learning put together. Benares had succeeded in shaking off the paralysis that had overtaken her literary activity during the three previous centuries as a result of Muslim rule. She learnt how to adjust herself to the new depressing and discouraging situation. Of course it is true that most of the works produced by Benares were not independent works. They were of the nature of commentaries and compilations with a few exceptions. This observation, however, holds good of about 90\% works written in Sanskrit during the second millennium of the Christian era. The credit for retaining the popular faith in the old culture and religion of the land belongs in no small degree to a number of saint poets and authors of the Bhakti School, who flourished all over India during this dark and dismal age. The contribution of Benares in this respect is remarkable. Rāmānand, one of the early and earnest Vaiṣṇava reformers, flourished in Benares during the 14th century; he used to live near the Panchaganga ghat. During the next century flourished his disciples Kabir and Raidas; of these the former was born in the precincts of Benares and his \emph{samādhi} has given the name to the Kabirchaura \emph{mohalla} of the city. Kabir was soon followed by Tulsidas, the famous author of the \emph{Rāmacharitamānasa}, who carried on his religious and literary activities at Benares till his death in 1623 A. D. Benares may well be proud of the religious and literary work of these three writers, who made the city a centre of the medieval Bhakti movement. Both Guru Nanak and Chaitanya, the leaders of the Bhakti movement in the Punjab and Bengal respectively, visited Benares in order to expound their gospel religion and culture},

  abstract  = {Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was a staunch advocate for nature cure. He promoted the use of earth, air, sunlight, water and diet not only to treat medical problems but also as an integral feature of a programme for comprehensive public health reform. As such, Gandhi conceptualised healthcare as an encompassing, biomoral project designed to produce Swaraj in the broadest sense of the term. Nature cure was, in other words, fundamental to sarvodaya as a form of praxis. This essay focusses on Gandhi’s establishment of Nisargopchar, a nature cure ashram in the Uruli Kanchan village, and the conceptualisation of the ashram within the framework of the constructive programme and rural development more broadly. This focus not only highlights fundamental tensions and contradictions of social class within the Gandhian project but also sheds light on the way in which Gandhi’s vision of biomoral reform provides a perspective on how these contradictions and tensions, which are especially visible in contemporary India, reflect larger, more encompassing global problems of consumption, development and progress measured in terms of material wealth.},

The progress and change of perspective in this field of knowledge have been spectacular, moving from a scientific and prescriptive vision of translation to a descriptive one, which, in turn, has given way to the interaction between translation and culture. The starting point of this book is the idea that language is not neutral and that, insofar as language is the translator's tool, the act of translating is not neutral either. Translation shapes the way in which a given society receives a work, an author, a literature, or a culture; therefore it is necessary to locate the subversive aspects of translations in the larger framework of social interaction. Translating can never be neutral, as it is charged with ideology and 'games of power'. The most attractive feature of this anthology is that in the essays we can see how norms vary from one culture to another, how a 'strong' society may wish to alter those of a 'weaker' one through translation, or how the canon can be modified. Translation as a political or manipulative action will be much less dangerous if we are aware of its consequences. This book will help us to reflect on this problem.},

  abstract = {Landscapes might be a minor topic in the field of classical Āyurveda; however, they actually do play an important role in several contexts. For example, the constitution of the patients depends on their natural surroundings, the quality of food and medicinal plants is defined by the habitat of plants and animals, and the wholesomeness of drinking water is determined by the clime at its source. Thus, we find references to all kinds of landscapes in the compendia of ancient Indian medicine. However, not only terrestrial space is mapped. Water and sky as well are regarded as living environments of animals which in turn serve as food for humans and have specific characteristics according to their roaming area.

This study is based on a search for references to landscapes in all possible contexts of the four eminent source texts of ancient Indian medicine, the Carakasaṃhitā, the Suśrutasaṃhitā, the Aṣṭāṅgasaṃgraha and the Aṣṭāṅgahṛdayasaṃhitā. Its first part presents the gathered information systematically rearranged and discusses the differences and similarities between plant and animal habitat, as well as the human environment. The second half is dedicated to the specific types of landscapes, describing them based on the findings in the source texts and showing their various impact on water, plants, animals, people and medicinal practice in  general.},

Cross-cultural influences are everywhere in evidence, in the food people eat, the clothes they wear, and in the places they worship. This was especially the case in the India that existed from 1200 to 1750, before the European intervention. The book takes the reader on a journey across the political, economic, religious and cultural landscapes of medieval India, from the Ghurid conquests and the Dehli Sultanate to the great court of the Mughals. This was a time of conquest and consolidation, when Muslims and Hindus came together to create a unique culture which still resonates in today's India. As the first survey of its kind in over a decade, the book is a tour de force. It is beautifully illustrated and fluently composed, with a cast of characters which will educate students and general readers alike. \\- Covers a critical period of modern India's formation from 1200 to 1750 \\- Written in an accessible and engaging manner, the book is ideally suited for general readers and students seeking an overview of South Asia \\- With numerous features including: photographs of monuments, paintings, and artefacts, glossary of Indian terms, list of biographies of prominent people, and over ten maps.

  abstract      = {Ancient history relies on disciplines such as epigraphy, the study of ancient inscribed texts, for evidence of the recorded past. However, these texts, "inscriptions", are often damaged over the centuries, and illegible parts of the text must be restored by specialists, known as epigraphists. This work presents Pythia, the first ancient text restoration model that recovers missing characters from a damaged text input using deep neural networks. Its architecture is carefully designed to handle long-term context information, and deal efficiently with missing or corrupted character and word representations. To train it, we wrote a non-trivial pipeline to convert PHI, the largest digital corpus of ancient Greek inscriptions, to machine actionable text, which we call PHI-ML. On PHI-ML, Pythia's predictions achieve a 30.1% character error rate, compared to the 57.3% of human epigraphists. Moreover, in 73.5% of cases the ground-truth sequence was among the Top-20 hypotheses of Pythia, which effectively demonstrates the impact of this assistive method on the field of digital epigraphy, and sets the state-of-the-art in ancient text restoration.},

  abstract  = {This chapter begins with a general definition of personality disorder that applies to each of the 10 specific personality disorders. A personality disorder is an enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of the individual’s culture, is pervasive and inflexible, has an onset in adolescence or early adulthood, is stable over time, and leads to distress or impairment. With any ongoing review process, especially one of this complexity, different viewpoints emerge, and an effort was made to accommodate them. Thus, personality disorders are included in both Sections II and III. The material in Section II represents an update of text associated with the same criteria found in DSM-IV-TR, whereas Section III includes the proposed research model for personality disorder diagnosis and conceptualization developed by the DSM-5 Personality and Personality Disorders Work Group. As this field evolves, it is hoped that both versions will serve clinical practice and research initiatives, respectively.The following personality disorders are included in this chapter.Paranoid personality disorder is a pattern of distrust and suspiciousness such that others’ motives are interpreted as malevolent.Schizoid personality disorder is a pattern of detachment from social relationships and a restricted range of emotional expression.Schizotypal personality disorder is a pattern of acute discomfort in close relationships, cognitive or perceptual distortions, and eccentricities of behavior.Antisocial personality disorder is a pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the rights of others.Borderline personality disorder is a pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects, and marked impulsivity.Histrionic personality disorder is a pattern of excessive emotionality and attention seeking.Narcissistic personality disorder is a pattern of grandiosity, need for admiration, and lack of empathy.Avoidant personality disorder is a pattern of social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and hypersensitivity to negative evaluation.Dependent personality disorder is a pattern of submissive and clinging behavior related to an excessive need to be taken care of.Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is a pattern of preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and control.Personality change due to another medical condition is a persistent personality disturbance that is judged to be due to the direct physiological effects of a medical condition (e.g., frontal lobe lesion).Other specified personality disorder and unspecified personality disorder is a category provided for two situations: 1) the individual’s personality pattern meets the general criteria for a personality disorder, and traits of several different personality disorders are present, but the criteria for any specific personality disorder are not met; or 2) the individual’s personality pattern meets the general criteria for a personality disorder, but the individual is considered to have a personality disorder that is not included in the DSM-5 classification (e.g., passive-aggressive personality disorder).The personality disorders are grouped into three clusters based on descriptive similarities. Cluster A includes paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal personality disorders. Individuals with these disorders often appear odd or eccentric. Cluster B includes antisocial, borderline, histrionic, and narcissistic personality disorders. Individuals with these disorders often appear dramatic, emotional, or erratic. Cluster C includes avoidant, dependent, and obsessive-compulsive personality disorders. Individuals with these disorders often appear anxious or fearful. It should be noted that this clustering system, although useful in some research and educational situations, has serious limitations and has not been consistently validated. Moreover, individuals frequently present with co-occurring personality disorders from different clusters. Prevalence estimates for the different clusters suggest 5.7\% for disorders in Cluster A, 1.5\% for disorders in Cluster B, 6.0\% for disorders in Cluster C, and 9.1\% for any personality disorder, indicating frequent co-occurrence of disorders from different clustersLenzenweger et al. 2007. Data from the 2001–2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions suggest that approximately 15\% of U.S. adults have at least one personality disorderGrant et al. 2004.},
  annote    = {Narcissistic Personality Disorder Diagnostic Criteria 301.81 (F60.81) A pervasive pattern of grandiosity (in fantasy or behavior), need for admiration, and lack of empathy, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by five (or more) of the following: Has a grandiose sense of self-importance (e.g., exaggerates achievements and talents, expects to be recognized as superior without commensurate achievements). Is preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love. Believes that he or she is “special” and unique and can only be understood by, or should associate with, other special or high-status people (or institutions). Requires excessive admiration. Has a sense of entitlement (i.e., unreasonable expectations of especially favorable treatment or automatic compliance with his or her expectations). Is interpersonally exploitative (i.e., takes advantage of others to achieve his or her own ends). Lacks empathy: is unwilling to recognize or identify with the feelings and needs of others. Is often envious of others or believes that others are envious of him or her. Shows arrogant, haughty behaviors or attitudes. Diagnostic Features The essential feature of narcissistic personality disorder is a pervasive pattern of grandiosity, need for admiration, and lack of empathy that begins by early adulthood and is present in a variety of contexts. Individuals with this disorder have a grandiose sense of self-importance (Criterion 1). They routinely overestimate their abilities and inflate their accomplishments, often appearing boastful and pretentious. They may blithely assume that others attribute the same value to their efforts and may be surprised when the praise they expect and feel they deserve is not forthcoming. Often implicit in the inflated judgments of their own accomplishments is an underestimation (devaluation) of the contributions of others. Individuals with narcissistic personality disorder are often preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love (Criterion 2). They may ruminate about “long overdue” admiration and privilege and compare themselves favorably with famous or privileged people. Individuals with narcissistic personality disorder believe that they are superior, special, or unique and expect others to recognize them as such (Criterion 3). They may feel that they can only be understood by, and should only associate with, other people who are special or of high status and may attribute “unique,” “perfect,” or “gifted” qualities to those with whom they associate. Individuals with this disorder believe that their needs are special and beyond the ken of ordinary people. Their own self-esteem is enhanced (i.e., “mirrored”) by the idealized value that they assign to those with whom they associate. They are likely to insist on having only the “top” person (doctor, lawyer, hairdresser, instructor) or being affiliated with the “best” institutions but may devalue the credentials of those who disappoint them. Individuals with this disorder generally require excessive admiration (Criterion 4). Their self-esteem is almost invariably very fragile. They may be preoccupied with how well they are doing and how favorably they are regarded by others. This often takes the form of a need for constant attention and admiration. They may expect their arrival to be greeted with great fanfare and are astonished if others do not covet their possessions. They may constantly fish for compliments, often with great charm. A sense of entitlement is evident in these individuals’ unreasonable expectation of especially favorable treatment (Criterion 5). They expect to be catered to and are puzzled or furious when this does not happen. For example, they may assume that they do not have to wait in line and that their priorities are so important that others should defer to them, and then get irritated when others fail to assist “in their very important work.” This sense of entitlement, combined with a lack of sensitivity to the wants and needs of others, may result in the conscious or unwitting exploitation of others (Criterion 6). They expect to be given whatever they want or feel they need, no matter what it might mean to others. For example, these individuals may expect great dedication from others and may overwork them without regard for the impact on their lives. They tend to form friendships or romantic relationships only if the other person seems likely to advance their purposes or otherwise enhance their self-esteem. They often usurp special privileges and extra resources that they believe they deserve because they are so special. Individuals with narcissistic personality disorder generally have a lack of empathy and have difficulty recognizing the desires, subjective experiences, and feelings of others (Criterion 7). They may assume that others are totally concerned about their welfare. They tend to discuss their own concerns in inappropriate and lengthy detail, while failing to recognize that others also have feelings and needs. They are often contemptuous and impatient with others who talk about their own problems and concerns. These individuals may be oblivious to the hurt their remarks may inflict (e.g., exuberantly telling a former lover that “I am now in the relationship of a lifetime!”; boasting of health in front of someone who is sick). When recognized, the needs, desires, or feelings of others are likely to be viewed disparagingly as signs of weakness or vulnerability. Those who relate to individuals with narcissistic personality disorder typically find an emotional coldness and lack of reciprocal interest. These individuals are often envious of others or believe that others are envious of them (Criterion 8). They may begrudge others their successes or possessions, feeling that they better deserve those achievements, admiration, or privileges. They may harshly devalue the contributions of others, particularly when those individuals have received acknowledgment or praise for their accomplishments. Arrogant, haughty behaviors characterize these individuals; they often display snobbish, disdainful, or patronizing attitudes (Criterion 9). For example, an individual with this disorder may complain about a clumsy waiter’s “rudeness” or “stupidity” or conclude a medical evaluation with a condescending evaluation of the physician. Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis Vulnerability in self-esteem makes individuals with narcissistic personality disorder very sensitive to “injury” from criticism or defeat. Although they may not show it outwardly, criticism may haunt these individuals and may leave them feeling humiliated, degraded, hollow, and empty. They may react with disdain, rage, or defiant counterattack. Such experiences often lead to social withdrawal or an appearance of humility that may mask and protect the grandiosity. Interpersonal relations are typically impaired because of problems derived from entitlement, the need for admiration, and the relative disregard for the sensitivities of others. Though overweening ambition and confidence may lead to high achievement, performance may be disrupted because of intolerance of criticism or defeat. Sometimes vocational functioning can be very low, reflecting an unwillingness to take a risk in competitive or other situations in which defeat is possible. Sustained feelings of shame or humiliation and the attendant self-criticism may be associated with social withdrawal, depressed mood, and persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) or major depressive disorder. In contrast, sustained periods of grandiosity may be associated with a hypomanic mood. Narcissistic personality disorder is also associated with anorexia nervosa and substance use disorders (especially related to cocaine). Histrionic, borderline, antisocial, and paranoid personality disorders may be associated with narcissistic personality disorder. Prevalence Prevalence estimates for narcissistic personality disorder, based on DSM-IV definitions, range from 0% to 6.2% in community samples( Dhawan et al. 2010 ). Development and Course Narcissistic traits may be particularly common in adolescents and do not necessarily indicate that the individual will go on to have narcissistic personality disorder. Individuals with narcissistic personality disorder may have special difficulties adjusting to the onset of physical and occupational limitations that are inherent in the aging process. Gender-Related Diagnostic Issues Of those diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder, 50%–75% are male. Differential Diagnosis Other personality disorders and personality traits Other personality disorders may be confused with narcissistic personality disorder because they have certain features in common. It is, therefore, important to distinguish among these disorders based on differences in their characteristic features. However, if an individual has personality features that meet criteria for one or more personality disorders in addition to narcissistic personality disorder, all can be diagnosed. The most useful feature in discriminating narcissistic personality disorder from histrionic, antisocial, and borderline personality disorders, in which the interactive styles are coquettish, callous, and needy, respectively, is the grandiosity characteristic of narcissistic personality disorder. The relative stability of self-image as well as the relative lack of self-destructiveness, impulsivity, and abandonment concerns also help distinguish narcissistic personality disorder from borderline personality disorder. Excessive pride in achievements, a relative lack of emotional display, and disdain for others’ sensitivities help distinguish narcissistic personality disorder from histrionic personality disorder. Although individuals with borderline, histrionic, and narcissistic personality disorders may require much attention, those with narcissistic personality disorder specifically need that attention to be admiring. Individuals with antisocial and narcissistic personality disorders share a tendency to be tough-minded, glib, superficial, exploitative, and unempathic. However, narcissistic personality disorder does not necessarily include characteristics of impulsivity, aggression, and deceit. In addition, individuals with antisocial personality disorder may not be as needy of the admiration and envy of others, and persons with narcissistic personality disorder usually lack the history of conduct disorder in childhood or criminal behavior in adulthood. In both narcissistic personality disorder and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, the individual may profess a commitment to perfectionism and believe that others cannot do things as well. In contrast to the accompanying self-criticism of those with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, individuals with narcissistic personality disorder are more likely to believe that they have achieved perfection. Suspiciousness and social withdrawal usually distinguish those with schizotypal or paranoid personality disorder from those with narcissistic personality disorder. When these qualities are present in individuals with narcissistic personality disorder, they derive primarily from fears of having imperfections or flaws revealed. Many highly successful individuals display personality traits that might be considered narcissistic. Only when these traits are inflexible, maladaptive, and persisting and cause significant functional impairment or subjective distress do they constitute narcissistic personality disorder. Mania or hypomania Grandiosity may emerge as part of manic or hypomanic episodes, but the association with mood change or functional impairments helps distinguish these episodes from narcissistic personality disorder. Substance use disorders Narcissistic personality disorder must also be distinguished from symptoms that may develop in association with persistent substance use.

The Mesmerizers employed by Dr. Esdaile were young men, Hindoos and Mahomedans, from 14 to 30 years of age, most of them compounders and dressers from the Hooghly Hospital. 9. To each patient a separate Mesmerizer was assigned. The room in which they operated was darkened, but from time to time the Committee were enabled to witness, through small apertures made in the door panels, the manner in which the processes were carried on. The patient lay on his back, the body naked from the waist upwards, and the thighs and legs bare; the Mesmerizer seated behind him at the head of the bed, leaning over him, the faces of both nearly in contact, the right hand being generally placed on the pit of the stomach, and passes made with one or both hands along the face, chiefly over the eyes. The Mesmerizer breathed frequently and gently over the patient's lips, eyes and nostrils. Profound silence was observed. These processes were continued for about two hours each day in ten cases, for eight hours in one cased in one day, and for six hours in another case, without interruption. \ldots 10. In seven cases [out of 10], in a period varying from one to seven sittings, deep sleep followed the performance of the processes above described. 11. This sleep in its most perfect state differed from ordinary natural sleep, as follows. The individual could not be aroused by loud noises; the pupils were insensible to light; and great, and in some cases apparently perfect, insensibility to pain was witnessed on burning, pinching, and cutting the skin and other sensitive organs. 12. This sleep in general character differed from that which would be produced by narcotic drugs, in the quickness with which , in eight cases out of ten, the patient was awoke, after certain transverse passes and fanning by the Mesmerizer, and blowing upon the face and on the eyes; in the natural condition of the pupils of the eyes and the conjunctive in all the cases after awaking; in the the absence of stertorous breathing and of subsequent delirium or hallucination, and of many other symptoms familiar to medical observers, and which are produced by Alcoholic Liquors, Opium, Hemp, and other Narcotic Drugs. \ldots 13. In seven cases Surgical operations were performed in the state of sleep above described. \ldots 31. \ldots In conclusion, the Committee are unanimously of opinion that great credit is due to Dr. Estaile for the zeal, ability, and boldness with which he has taken up and pursued this enquiry. His sphere, however, has been hitherto limited, but the Committee hope that his further investigations may be extended to Medical as well as Surgical cases, to European as well as Native patients, and to the elucidation of the several questions which have been adverted to in the course of this report.

  annotation       = {Plural Healing In Late Colonial India Refiguring Unani Tibb examines the ways in which unani tibb reconstituted its identity in the light of modernising trends at the turn of the twentieth century in India. It brings out the heterogeneity of unani tibb in late colonial India that frequently defies its commonly ascribed label as a ‘traditional Muslim system’ of medicine. Through an analysis of interconnecting themes Guy Attewell draws attention to the tensions manifest in different spheres of unani activity as practitioners reconfigured their knowledge and practices through the prisms of biomedical concepts, language, nationalist and communitarian politics, changing social and moral norms, and colonial-inspired models of legitimacy. The book shows that while tibb has always been a cosmopolitan profession, the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries saw a fundamental transition from a principally localised, personalised practice to one that had to engage and be represented in a mass, public arena for status, recognition and custom. This transition, the book argues, was neither complete nor uniform. The study draws on a range of material in Urdu, Arabic and Persian, including texts, pamphlets and journals, in addition to archival records in Hyderabad and London, to draw out the complexity and contingency in the evolution of a plural and extraordinarily dynamic tradition of healing.},

It situates his contributions within intense debates to define knowledge and the various fields of knowledge traditionally divided between the al-ʿulūm al-naqliyya, the ‘transmitted fields of knowledge,’ and the al-ʿulūm al-ʿaqliyya, the ‘rational fields of knowledge’. Here Baranī is shown to classify historiography within the al-ʿulūm al-naqliyya and to defend history writing against its critics. Understanding his efforts to integrate historiography within the transmitted fields of knowledge sheds new light on the intellectual history of Islamic South Asia and wider debates about the knowledge of history in the Middle East.},

In the pre-industrial world aromatic substances have always counted among the most prominent items of long-distance trade. The finest camphor came from Malaya, Borneo and Sumatra, but long-distance trade took it to societies at the geographical poles of demand - China and the medieval West already in late Antiquity (ca. 6th century A.D.). In India it was in use at an even much earlier period. <P>The present monograph opens with a survey of aromata generally - origins, time and place of demand - from the Ancient Civilizations to the Age of Discoveries. Chapter two concerns the natural history of camphor; subsequent chapters are organized by regions (India, Western Asia, the medieval West, South East Asia, China and Japan), with a postscript on Origins and Diffusion. <P>Evidence is drawn from an extensive range of sources in natural and cultural history.The work includes 15 original maps, 28 illustrations, and an extensive bibliography.}},

  abstract  = {In the context of colonial and post-colonial India, social scientific inquiry about the advent of Ayurveda into modernity has been documented and analysed as an encounter between Ayurveda and biomedicine. These studies have shown how Ayurveda as a medical knowledge system offered continuous contestation to the existing power structures at the level of market, state, and epistemology, challenging and creatively positing alternatives to biomedical pharmaceuticals. These alternatives represent a fascinating spectrum of ayurvedic products introduced to the market, ranging from tonics and digestives, cosmetics and beauty products, to new formulations aimed at common conditions, such as hepatitis and diabetes, the weak points of biomedical treatments. In this paper, I will analyse from a historical and epistemological perspective, an interesting trajectory that has led research by scholars and physicians from mainly looking at reformulating drugs in the beginning to reconciling basic ayurvedic parameters with biomedicine towards emphasising the processes and parameters of the ayurvedic system as a whole.},

Scientific Knowledge is the first introduction to social studies of scientific knowledge.

The authors, all noted for their contributions to science studies, have organized this book so that each chapter examines a key step in the process of doing science. Using case studies from cognitive science, physics, and biology to illustrate their descriptions and applications of the social study of science, they show how this approach provides a crucial perspective on how science is actually done.

Scientific Knowledge will be of interest not only to those engaged in science studies, but also to anyone interested in the practice of science.},

One branch went south-west, and one skull has been discovered at Mohenjodaro.  The other branch moved towards Eastern India without ... staying long in the central part of Northern India. ... They gave rise to Grierson's "outer band" of the IA languages, Bihari, Bengali, Assamese and Oriya.   During the 2nd millennium BCE the Vedic Aryans entered India through Afghanistan. p. 163: Barua rejects Suniti Kumar Chatterjee's theory of two Aryan waves, an early one designated Vrātyas and a later one of Vedic Indians.  He calls this an adaptation of Hoernle's speculation of a second Aryan intrusion through the Himalayas. Barua calls his theory the same as that of Rai Bahadur Ramaprasad Chanda's theory of a tribe of the Homo-Alpinus entering India and pushing towards the east giving rise to the Pisachi languges of Eastern India, etc. (p. 164)},

Such narratives account for two contrasting styles of self-presentation: first, they emphasize the connection between Goan doctors and the colonial endeavor, portraying military physicians as a kind of civilizing heroe in Africa; second, the narratives point to the marginal and subaltern role of Goan medical school graduates within the Portuguese colonial system. I will explore the relationship between these two opposing styles and suggest how identity-building efforts crystallized in a set of narratives about the history of medicine in India that highlights colonial links and obscures native contributions to medical knowledge. Data will be drawn from interviews with elderly Goan doctors, trained before 1961, from published historical accounts of medical teaching in India, and from documents written either to celebrate the existence of the Medical School of Goa or to analyze and intervene in the situation of Goan doctors serving in the colonies},

  abstract         = {The centennial celebration of the New Goa Medical-surgical School, held in 1942, glorified the institution's contribution to the consolidation of the Portuguese Empire in Africa. I observe the School from the perspective of the literature on medicine and empire, whose analyzes tend to view it as a tool for exercising biopower. I then question this hypothesis from the perspective of primary sources on the School's first decades, which paint a picture of frailty and administrative disregard that is not very compatible with an imperial project engineered to train physicians and disperse them throughout the colonies. I conclude that the School's creation stemmed from a process where local interests dominated, in a society where the categories "colonizer" and "colonized" were diluted within the complexities of social differentiation. It was with the twentieth-century rewriting of Portuguese colonial history that the narrative of imperial glorification appropriated the School.},

Comparison of race relations in the southern United States and relations between the untouchables and other castes in India demonstrates that the two systems are closely similar in operation despite differences of content. Low-caste status in India, as in America, is actively resented. Research emphasis upon the realities of structure and process as revealed by cross-cultural studies of caste interaction is more likely to lead to useful generalizations about this kind of social stratification and intergroup relations than is the more conventional emphasis upon differences of cultural content.},

A comparison of race and caste shows a remarkable similarity in the contrasting attitudes towards women of lower and higher ranks, characteristic of men in privileged positions in both systems. The sexual use and abuse of women appears in the most extreme forms in the treatment of women of the lowest rank by men of the highest; there is moreover an unremitting concern with the purity of women at the top, associated with ideas of bodily substance brought to light in recent studies of kinship. The article argues the case for limited comparisons and questions the utility of drawing radical contrasts between whole civilisations},

  abstract = {The Amaraughaprabodha is a Sanskrit Śaiva yoga text attributed by its colophons to Gorakṣanātha. It was first published by Kalyani Devi Mallik in 1954 and has been discussed in various secondary sources. Most notably, Christian Bouy (1994, pp. 18--19) identified this work as a source text for the Haṭhapradı̄pikā of Svātmārāma (mid-fifteenth century). This article presents new manuscript evidence for a shorter recension of the Amaraughaprabodha than the one published by Mallik. Comparing the differences between the short and long recensions reveals that the structure of the shorter one is more cohesive and closer to the original design of the work. The close relationship of the Amaraughaprabodha's short recension with an eleventh-century Vajrayāna work on yoga called the Amṛtasiddhi provides unique insights into how early teachings on Haṭhayoga were formulated. Although the practice of the physical techniques is largely the same in both texts, the author of the Amaraughaprabodha removed or obscured Vajrayāna terminology, added Śaiva metaphysics and framed Haṭhayoga as subordinate to a Śaiva yoga known as Rājayoga. This article proposes that the Amaraughaprabodha's short recension is probably the earliest known work to combine Haṭha- with Rājayoga, onthe basis of this recension's close relationship with the Amṛtasiddhi, its rudimentarynature and the likelihood that Svātmārāma used it, and not the long recension, for composing the Haṭhapradı̄pikā.},

  abstract         = {Peter C. Bisschop Skandapurāṇa 167 is concerned with a description of Śaiva sacred sites and may be dated to the latter half of the 6th or first half of the 7th century. As such it is a very valuable source for the history and topography of early Saivism. In addition it contains an account of the origins of the Pasupata movement in its descriptions of Karohana, the site of Siva's descent as Lakulisa. The present volume contains a critical edition of two different versions of Skandapurāṇa 167, one transmitted in early Nepalese palm-leaf manuscripts, another transmitted in two later recensions styled Ambikakhanda and Revakhanda. The latter version has never been published before and opens up new perspectives for the study of the transmission of Puranic literature and the historical development of Śaivism. The introduction deals with the sacred topography of Śaivism, the early Pasupata movement and editorial principles. The editions are preceded by an English synopsis and are accompanied by an extensive philological and historical commentary.},

  abstract  = {During the past forty years, thousands of studies have been carried out on the subject of happiness. Some have explored the levels of happiness or dissatisfaction associated with typical daily activities, such as working, seeing friends, or doing household chores. Others have tried to determine the extent to which income, family, religion, and other factors are associated with the satisfaction people feel about their lives. The Gallup organization has begun conducting global surveys of happiness, and several countries are considering publishing periodic reports on the growth or decline of happiness among their people. One nation, tiny Bhutan, has actually made “Gross National Happiness” the central aim of its domestic policy. How might happiness research affect government policy in the United States — and beyond? In The Politics of Happiness, former Harvard president Derek Bok examines how governments could use the rapidly growing research data on what makes people happy — in a variety of policy areas to increase well-being and improve the quality of life for all their citizens.

Bok first describes the principal findings of happiness researchers. He considers how reliable the results appear to be and whether they deserve to be taken into account in devising government policies. Recognizing both the strengths and weaknesses of happiness research, Bok looks at the policy implications for economic growth, equality, retirement, unemployment, health care, mental health, family programs, education, and government quality, among other subjects. Timely and incisive, The Politics of Happiness sheds new light on what makes people happy and how government policy could foster greater satisfaction for all.},

  annotation       = {Uncorrected/Not for publication - 4.5.2000 [\ldots ] SHRI DRUPAD BORGOHAIN (ASSAM) Thank you very much, Sir, for giving me a few minutes. I would like to read out my few points to keep pace with the time. Please don't mind, Sir. Health care is a very important point, as it has a direct relation with the development of the country. In other words, all-round economic growth and development of a nation has a relationship with the health-care of the people of that nation. So, to achieve a proper economic growth and advancement of a nation, health care is an utmost necessity. But, unfortunately, the relationship of economic growth and development with health care is not properly maintained in our country. In spite of these weaknesses, we have noticed some advancement and improvement in health care and implementation of disease-control programmes. Firstly, the death rate has fallen from 25.1 to 9.0 in 1996. Secondly, life expectancy has increased from 32 years in 1947 to 62 years in 1996. Yet; the general scenario of health is still not very encouraging, despite these important advances made in the field. Morbidity due to non-communicable diseases like cancer and cardio-vascular diseases is on the increase. Epidemics of communicable diseases are quite serious in certain parts and in certain seasons. An uncurable disease like AIDS is also taking its toll. All these things are happening; the reasons being: growth in population, urbanisation, unplanned growth of towns and slums in the country, migration, changes in the life style of the people, poverty, malnutrition, degradation of the environment, etc. During the last fifty-two years of Independence, the health infrastructure has been expanding in our country. Yet, the planning of manpower engaged in this sector has been dismally poor. Health workers, technicians, nurses, midwives, etc. are quite short of the essentialities required for health care. This is stark reality. If we take the scenario of investment in the field of health care by the Government, the statistics reveal that it has been steadily declining. While 3.3\% of the total plan allocation was earmarked in the first Five Year Plan, it came down to 1.75\% in the Eighth Plan and just went up to 2.25\% in the Ninth Plan. Sir, we have a comprehensive National Health Policy which was adopted in 1983. A massive exercise was undertaken to adopt this policy. The World Health Organisation has rightly pointed out , ``Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well being and the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, religion, belief, economic or social conditions." So, to attain good health is a fundamental right of every citizen. But I am sorry to say that health is still not a fundamental right in our country. This is a serious weakness on the part of the Central Government. As good health has a linkage with the development of the country, the Ministry of Health must take steps to transform the right to good health into a fundamental right in our country. I request our hon. Minister to do so. Now I come to the National Health Policy. Before adopting the National Health Policy, several committees on Health were formed and every such committee had given its recommendations. These committees were : The Bhore Committee of 1946, the Mudaliar Committee of 1961, the Kartar Singh Committee of 1973, the Srivastava Committee of 1975 and the Ramalingaswami Committee of 1981. After these massive exercises, the Central Government had formulated and adopted the National Health Policy in 1983. This new Health Policy has also a connection with the Alma Ata Declaration of 1978. The recommendations of different committees had given an impetus to the development in the medical field. The All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) is the product of the Bhore Committee, strengthening of primary health centres was recommended by the Mudaliar Committee; the Kartar Singh and Srivastava Committees made recommendations for multipurpose health workers, for medical education and for support of manpower, with emphasis on community health workers, and the Ramalingaswami Committee gave shape to the ``Health for All" declaration. Apart from these recommendations, a number of health initiatives taken since independence have also influenced the present health scenario o f the country. The National Health Policy mainly stressed ``Health for All" by 2000 A.D. Priority was given to the expansion of rural health care infrastructure, through a network of community health centres, primary health centres and sub-centres. High priority has been given to the development of primary health centres located close to the people. (contd. By NNNN) ; ; Uncorrected/Not for publication - 4.5.2000 VK/NNNN-1/7.05 SHRI DRUPAD BORGOHAIN (CONTD): The primary health centres should be located very near. THE VICE-CHAIRMAN (SHRI RAMA SHANKER KAUSHIK): Please conclude. SHRI DRUPAD BORGOHAIN: Though the target was 'Health for All' by 2000 AD, it could not be achieved within the time frame and the slogan had to be changed to 'Health for the underprivileged' by 2000 AD. This was proposed to be achieved through the strengthening of the infrastructure for primary health care with about 30,000 people as the basic unit. As the statistics show, this target is also not going to be achieved in the year 2000. As per the slogan 'Health for All' there are not adequte sub-centres, primary health centres and community health centres. As per the 1991-Census, the requirement of sub-centres, PHCs, and CHCs was 1,34,108, 22,349 and 5,587 respectively. In 1996 the number of sub-centres was 1,32,730. The number of PHCs was 21,854 and the number of CHCs was 2424. So there is a lot of gap. According to the Health Policy of 1983, primary health care was the key area. But the Health Ministry has failed in many respects. There are many primay health care centres but the activities are lagging behind. Buildings are in a very bad shape. Doctors are not available in required number. There is a shortage of nurses. Thank you. (ENDS)},

  abstract         = {In the past twenty years, much time, effort, and money has been expended on designing an unambiguous representation of natural language to make them accessible to computer processing, These efforts have centered around creating schemata designed to parallel logical relations with relations expressed by the syntax and semantics of natural languages, which are clearly cumbersome and ambiguous in their function as vehicles for the transmission of logical data. Understandably, there is a widespread belief that natural languages are unsuitable for the transmission of many ideas that artificial languages can render with great precision and mathematical rigor. But this dichotomy, which has served as a premise underlying much work in the areas of linguistics and artificial intelligence, is a false one. There is at least one language, Sanskrit, which for the duration of almost 1000 years was a living spoken language with a considerable literature of its own. Besides works of literary value, there was a long philosophical and grammatical tradition that has continued to exist with undiminished vigor until the present century. Among the accomplishments of the grammarians can be reckoned a method for paraphrasing Sanskrit in a manner that is identical not only in essence but in form with current work in Artificial Intelligence. This article demonstrates that a natural language can serve as an artificial language also, and that much work in AI has been reinventing a wheel millenia old. First, a typical Knowledge Representation Scheme (using Semantic Nets) will be laid out, followed by an outline of the method used by the ancient Indian grammarians to analyze sentences unambiguously. Finally, the clear parallelism between the two will be demonstrated, and the theoretical implications of this equivalence will be given.},

  abstract         = {This article explores the engagements between the colonial state and indigenous medical practitioners in the Madras Presidency in the early nineteenth century; a period characterised by openness and ambiguous relations. An analysis of textual representations of the ‘native practitioner’ reveals ambiguity. Often the practitioners were portrayed as representing flawed systems of knowledge, yet possessing valuable insight into specific medical practices. Texts written for internal administrative purposes tended, however, to view the native practitioner more as a resource for the colonial state than a representative of worthless bodies of knowledge. Turning to actual engagements with native practitioners a varied, context-sensitive picture emerges. In connection with the campaign to prevent smallpox, the native practitioner was envisaged as both a self-interested entrepreneur and a zealous bureaucratic servant. When an epidemic fever struck the southern part of the Presidency, it was suggested that the colonial authorities continue a pre-colonial practice and distribute native practitioners in the villages through grants in revenue. Finally, when cholera struck dramatically in south India from 1818 the colonial authorities resorted to extensive hiring of practitioners on a short-term basis. The variety of ways in which the colonial authorities came to terms with the native practitioner—from mainly dismissive accounts to praise of their usefulness in specific disease control—reminds us that we need to differentiate our understanding of the colonial encounter not only according to time and place but also according to administrative context.},

This book concentrates on the way in which the two, after an initial period of relative independence, confronted each other, both in and around the royal courts and in society at large. In this confrontation, Buddhism was strong in philosophical debate, but could not compete with Brahmanism in the services it could provide to the centres of political power, primarily ritual protection and practical advice. Buddhism evolved in both areas, providing practical advice to lay people and rulers from early Mahayana onward, and ritual protection in its Tantric developments. Some of these developments came too late, though, and could not prevent the disappearance of Buddhism from the subcontinent.},

  abstract         = {This book argues for the central role played by absorption in the functioning of the human mind. The importance of absorption makes itself felt in different ways; the two studies combined in this book concentrate on two of them. The first one argues that, largely as a result of language acquisition, humans have two levels of cognition, which in normal circumstances are simultaneously active. Absorption is a (or the) means to circumvent some, perhaps all, of the associations that characterize one of these two levels of cognition, resulting in what is sometimes referred to as mystical experience, but which is not confined to mysticism and plays a role in various {\textquotedblleft}religious{\textquotedblright} phenomena, and elsewhere. The second study provides a theoretical context for the observation that absorption is a source of pleasure. Since the human mind is at least in part guided by pleasure, which it seeks to repeat, states of absorption leave memory traces that subsequently direct the mind. However, these memory traces do not {\textquotedblleft}recall{\textquotedblright} the states of absorption, but rather the objects or circumstances that accompanied them. The resulting activity of the mind differs in this way from person to person, and can pursue wildly diverging goals.},

No longer primarily a sacrificial tradition, it became a mainly socio-political ideology that borrowed much (including the belief in rebirth and karmic retribution) from the eastern region in which Buddhism and Jainism had arisen. Its revival went hand in hand with the elaboration of behavioural and theoretical innovations, one of whose purposes was to justify the claimed superiority of Brahmins.},

  abstract  = {The historical interface between science and religion was depicted as an unbridgeable conflict in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. Starting in the 1970s, such a conception was too simplistic and not at all accurate when considering the totality of that relationship. This volume evaluates the utility of the "complexity principle" in past, present, and future scholarship. First put forward by historian John Brooke over twenty-five years ago, the complexity principle rejects the idea of a single thesis of conflict or harmony, or integration or separation, between science and religion.Rethinking History, Science, and Religion brings together an interdisciplinary group of scholars at the forefront of their fields to consider whether new approaches to the study of science and culture-such as recent developments in research on science and the history of publishing, the global history of science, the geographical examination of space and place, and science and media-have cast doubt on the complexity thesis, or if it remains a serviceable historiographical model.},

Many practitioners believe that the postures derive from an ancient original set of eighty-four asanas. This book, for the first time, traces traditions of eighty-four postures by examining original materials, including drawings, descriptions in older Indic texts and modern publications which reflect contemporary traditions. It also takes up a number of broad issues related to the topic of Yoga postures so as to provide the reader with a larger context.},

It is the purpose of the present article to provide this.},

  abstract             = {The penetration of Mughal power into previously autonomous regional kingdoms produced significant political, but also literary effects. In this article, I trace the advent of the Mughal political order to the princely state of Orcha (located in what is now north-western Madhya Pradesh) through the eyes of Kesavdas (fl. 1600), the leading poet from that court. Kesavdas is famous in Hindi literary circles as one of the progenitors of the Brajbhasha riti tradition, a constellation of courtly poetic and intellectual practices that flourished in a climate of mixed Mughal and sub-imperial patronage. There is a pronounced tendency to think of KesavdasṂï¿½"s work (and that of most riti poets) as a corpus of baroque, purely decorative poems largely comprising time-worn erotic and devotional themes. This preliminary study of KesavdasṂï¿½"s three historical poems will help to complicate such an understanding by bringing into our conceptual purview a fuller range of riti textual expression. These lesser known works by one of the foremost riti poets are certainly striking for their literary accomplishments, but they also serve as an invaluable window onto a critical moment in Orcha history. They constitute the perfect testing ground for the enterprise of retrieving historical meaning from the literary sources that were the dominant form of pre-modern Indian courtly self-expression, and the methodology employed here is to critically engage both aesthetic and historical perspectives simultaneously.},

The delay of my Amildars, in furnishing the requisite returns, has hitherto prevented my submitting to you the enclosed state­ment called for in your orders of the 25th July 1822, and 19th of June last. 2. The population of this District is specified in the enclosed statement at 9,27,857 or little less than a million of souls. The number of schools is only 533 containing no more than, 6,641 scholars, or about twelve to each school, and not seven individu­als in a thousand, of the entire population. 3. The Hindoo scholars are in number 6,398, the Mussulman scholars only 243, and the whole of these are males, with the exception of only sixty girls, who are all Hindoos exclusively. 4. The English language is taught in one school only. The Tamil in four, the Persian in twenty-one, the Mahratta in twenty-three, the Teloogoo in two hundred and twenty-six, and the Carnataca in two hundred and thirty-five. Besides these, there are twenty-three places of instruction, attended by Bramins exclusively, in which some of the Hindoo sciences, such as Theology, Astronomy, Logic and Law, are still imperfectly taught in the Sanscrit Language. 5. In these places of Sanscrit instruction in the Hindoo scienc­es, attended by youths, and often by persons far advanced in life, education is conducted on a plan entirely different from that pursued in the schools, in which children are taught read­ing, writing, and arithmetic only, in the several vernacular dialects of the country. I shall endeavour to give a brief out­line of the latter, as to them the general population of the country is confined, and as that population consists chiefly of Hindoos, I shall not dwell on the few Mussulman schools in which Persian is taught. 6. The education of the Hindoo youth generally commences when they are five years old. On reaching this age, the master and scholars of the school to which the boy is to be sent, are invit­ed to the house of his parents. The whole are seated in a circle round an image of Gunasee, and the child to be initiated is placed exactly opposite to it. The school master, sitting by his side, after having burnt incense and presented offerings, causes the child to repeat a prayer to Gunasee entreating wisdom. He then guides the child to write with its finger in rice the mystic name of the deity, and is dismissed with a present from the parents, according to their ability. The child, next morning commences the great work of his education. 7. Some children continue at school only five years, the parents, through poverty, or other circumstances, being often obliged to take them away, and consequently, in such cases, the merest smattering of an education is obtained; and when parents take a lively inter­est in the culture of their children’s minds, they not infre­quently continue at school as long as fourteen and fifteen years. 8. The internal routine of duty for each day will be found, with very few exceptions, and little variation, the same in schools. The hour generally for opening school is six o’clock. The first child who enters has the name of Saraswatee, or the Goddess of learning, written upon the palm of his hand, as a sign of honor, and, on the hand of the second, a cypher is written, to show that he is worthy, neither of praise nor censure, the third scholar receives a gentle stripe; the fourth two, and every succeeding scholar that comes an additional one. This custom as well as the punishments in native schools, seem of a severe kind. The idle scholar is flogged, and often suspended by both hands, and a pulley, to the roof, or obliged to kneel down and rise incessant­ly, which is most painful and fatiguing but perhaps a healthy mode of punishment. 9. When the whole are assembled, the scholars according to their number and attainments, are divided into several classes. The lower ones of which are placed partly under the care of monitors, whilst the higher ones are more immediately under the superinten­dence of the master, who at the same time has his eye upon the whole school. The number of classes is generally four; and a scholar rises from one to the other, according to his capacity and progress. The first business of a child on entering school is to obtain a knowledge of the letters, which he learns by writing them with his finger on the ground in sand, and not by pronounc­ing the alphabet as among European nations. When he becomes pretty dexterous in writing with his finger in sand, he has then the privilege of writing either with an iron style on cadjan leaves, or with a reed on paper, and sometimes on the leaves of the aristolochia identica, or with a kind of pencil on the Hulli­gi or Kadata, which answer the purpose of slates. The two latter in these districts are the most common. One of these is a common oblong board about a foot in width and three feet in length. This board, when plained smooth, has only to be smeared with a little rice and pulverized charcoal and it is then fit for use. The other is made of cloth, first stiffened with rice water, doubled in folds, resembling a book, and is then covered with a composi­tion of charcoal and several gums. The writing on either these may be effaced by a wet cloth. The pencil used is called Buttapa, a kind of white clay substance, somewhat resembling a crayon, with the exception of being rather harder. 10. Having attained a thorough knowledge of the letters, the scholar next learns to write the compounds, or the manner of embodying the symbols of the vowels in the consonants and the formation of syllables, etc., then the names of men, villages, animals, etc., and finally arithmetical signs. He then commits to memory an addition table, and counts from one to a hundred; he afterwards writes easy sums in addition, and subtraction of money; multiplication and the reduction of money, measures, etc. Here great pains are taken with the scholars, in teaching him the fractions of an integer, which descend, not be tens as in our decimal fractions, but by fours, and are carried to a great extent. In order that these fractions, together with the arith­metical table, in addition, multiplication, and those on the threefold measures of capacity, weight, and extent, may be ren­dered quite familiar to the minds of the scholars, they are made to stand up twice a day, in rows, and repeat the whole after one of the monitors. 11. The other parts of a native education consist in deciphering various kinds of hand writing, in public and other letters, which the school master collects from the different sources; writing common letters, drawing up forms of agreement; reading; fables and legendary tales; and committing various kinds of poetry to memory, chiefly with a view to attain distinctness and clearness in pronunciation, together with readiness and correctness in reading any kind of composition. 12. The three books which are most common in all the schools, and which are used indiscriminately by the several castes, are the Ramayanum, Maha Bharata, and Bhagvata; but the children of the manufacturing class of people have in addition to the above, books peculiar to their own religious tenets; such as the Naga­lingayna Kutha, Vishvakurma Poorana, Kumalesherra Kalikamahata; and those who wear the Lingum such as the Busvapoorana, Raghavan­kunkauya Geeroja Kullana, Unabhavamoorta, Chenna Busavaswara Poorana, Gurilagooloo, etc., which are all considered sacred, and are studied with a view of subserving their several religious creeds. 13. The lighter kind of stories which are read for amusement, are generally the Punchatantra, Bhatalapunchavansatee, Punklee Soo­pooktahuller, Mahantarungenee. The books on the principles of the vernacular languages themselves, are the several dictionaries and grammars, such as the Nighantoo, Umara, Subdamumbured, Shub­deemunee Durpana, Vyacurna Andradeepeca, Andhranamasungraha, etc., etc., but these last, and similar books, which are most essen­tial, and, without which, no accurate or extensive knowledge of the vernacular languages can be attained, are, from the high price of manuscripts and the general poverty of the masters, of all books, the most uncommon in the Native Schools; and such of them which are found there are in consequence of the ignorance, carelessness, and indolence of copyists in general, full of blunders, and in every way most incorrect and imperfect. 14. The whole of the books, however, in the Teloogoo and Carnata­ca schools, which are by far the most numerous in this district, whether they treat of religion, amusement, or the principles of these languages, are in verse; and in a dialect quite distinct from that of conversation and business. The alphabets of the two dialects are the same, and he who reads the one, can read, but not understand, the other also. The natives, therefore, read these (unintelligible) books to them, to acquire the power of reading letters, in the common dialect of business; but the poetical is quite distinct from the prose dialect, which they speak and write; and though they read these books, it is to the pronunciation of the syllables, not to the meaning or construc­tion of the words, that they attend. Indeed few teachers can explain, and still fewer scholars understand, the purport of the numerous books which they thus learn to repeat from memory. Every school boy can repeat verbatim a vast number of verses, of the meaning of which, he knows no more than the parrot that has been taught to utter certain words. Accordingly, from studies, in which he has spent many a day of laborious, but fruitless toil, the native scholar gains no improvement, except the exercise of memory and the power to read and write on the common business of life; he makes no addition to his stock of useful knowledge, and acquires no moral impressions. He has spent his youth in reading syllables, not words, and, on entering into life, he meets with hundreds and thousands of books of the meaning of which he can form not even the most distant conjecture, and as to the declen­sion of a noun, or the conjugation of a verb, he knows no more than of the most abstruse problem in Euclid. It is not to be wondered at, with such an imperfect education, that, in writing a common letter to their friends, orthographical errors and other violations of gram{3}, may be met with in almost every line written by a native. 15. The government could not promote the improved education of their native subjects in these districts more, than by patroniz­ing versions, in the common prose and spoken dialect, of the most moral parts of their popular poets and elementary works, now committed to memory in unintelligible verse. He who could read would then understand what he reads, which is far from the case at present. I am acquainted with many persons very capable of executing such a task; and, in the Teloogoo language, would gladly superintend it, as far as is in my power, at this distance from the Presidency. 16. The economy with which children are taught to write in the native schools, and the system by which the more advanced scholars are caused to teach the less advanced and at the same time to confirm their own knowledge is certainly admirable, and well deserved the imitation it has received in England. The chief defects in the native schools are the nature of the books and learning taught and the want of competent masters. 17. Imperfect, however, as the present education of the natives is, there are a few who possess the means to command it for their children even were books of a proper kind plentiful and the master every way adequate to the task imposed upon him, he would make no advance from one class to another, except as he might be paid for his labour. While learning the first rudiments, it is common for the scholar to pay to the teacher a quarter of a rupee, and when arrived as far as to write on paper, or at the higher branches of arithmetic, half a rupee per mensem. But in proceeding further such as explaining books, which are all writ­ten in verse, giving the meaning of Sanscrit words, and illus­trating the principles of the vernacular languages, such demands are made as exceed the means of most parents. There is, there­fore, no alternative, but that of leaving their children only partially instructed, and consequently ignorant of the most essential and useful parts of a liberal education. But there are multitudes who cannot even avail themselves of the advantages of this system, defective as it is. 18. I am sorry to state that this is ascribable to the gradual but general impoverishment of the country. The means of the manufacturing classes have been, of late years greatly dimin­ished, by the introduction of our own European manufactures, in lieu of the Indian cotton fabrics. The removal of many of our troops, from our own territories, to the distant frontiers of our newly subsidized allies, has also, of late years, affected the demand for grain, the transfer of the capital of the country, from the Native Governments, and their Officers, who liberally expended it in India, to Europeans, restricted by law from em­ploying it even temporarily in India, and daily draining it from the land, has likewise tended to this effect which has not been alleviated by a less rigid enforcement of the revenue due to the state. The greater part of the middling and lower classes of the people are now unable to defray the expenses incident upon the education of their offspring, while their necessities require the assistance of their children as soon as their tender limbs are capable of the smallest labour. 19. It cannot have escaped the Government that of nearly a mil­lion of souls in this district, not 7,000 are now at school; a proportion which exhibits but too strongly the result above stated. In many villages, where formerly there were schools, there are now none; and in many others, where there were large schools, now only a few of the children of the most opulent are taught, others being unable, from poverty, to attend or to pay what is demanded. 20. Such is the state, in this district, of the various schools, in which reading writing, and arithmetic, are taught in the vernacular dialects of the country, as has been always usual in India, by teachers who are paid by their scholars. The higher branches of learning on the contrary, have always, in this coun­try, been taught in Sanscrit; and it has ever in India, been deemed below the dignity of science, for her professors to barter it for hire. Lessons in Theology, Astronomy, Logic and Law, continue to be given gratuitously as of old, by a few learned Bramins, to some of their disciples. But learning, though, it may proudly decline to sell its stores, has never flourished in any country, except under the encouragement of the ruling power and the countenance and support, once given to science in this part of India, have long been withheld. 21. Of the 533 institutions for education, now existing in this district, I am ashamed to say not one now derives any support from the state. I have therefore received, with peculiar satis­faction, the inquiries instituted by the Honorable the Governor-in-Council, on this interesting subject; and trust that this part of India may benefit from the liberality which dictated the record of his intention, to grant new funds where the same may be deemed expedient, and to restore to their original purpose, all funds diverted from this source. 22. There is no doubt that in former times, especially under the Hindoo Governments very large grants, both in money, and in land, were issued for the support of learning. Considerable Yeomiahs, or grants of money, now paid to Bramins from my treasury, and many of the numerous and valuable Shotrium villages, now in the enjoyment of Bramins in this district, who receive one-fourth, one-third, one-half, two-thirds, and sometimes the whole, of their annual revenue, {5}, I think, be traced to this source. Though it did not consist with the dignity of learning to receive from her votaries hire; it has always in India been deemed the duty of Government to evince to her the highest respect, and to grant to her those emoluments which she could not, consistently with her character receive from other sources; the grants issued by former governments, on such occasions, contained, therefore, no unbecoming stipulations on conditions. They all purport to flow from the free bounty of the ruling power, merely to aid the maintenance of some holy or learned man, or to secure his prayers for the state. But they were almost universally granted to learned or religious persons, who maintained a school for one or more of the sciences, and taught therein gratuitously; and though not expressed in the deed itself, the duty of continuing such gratuitous instruction was certainly implied in all such grants. 23. The British Government, with its distinguished liberality, has continued all grants of this kind and even in many cases where it was evident that they were merely of a personal nature. But they have not, until now, intimated any intention to enforce the implied, but now dormant, condition of these grants. The revenue of the original grantee has descended, without much in­quiry, to his heirs. But his talents and acquirements have not been equally hereditary, and the descendants of the original grantees will rarely be found to possess either their learning, or powers of instruction. Accordingly, considerable alienations of revenue, which formerly did honor to the state, by upholding and encouraging learning, have deteriorated, under our rule, into the means of supporting ignorance; whilst science deserted by the powerful aid she formerly received from government, has often been reduced to beg her scanty and uncertain meal from the chance benevolence of charitable individuals; and it would be difficult to point out any period in the history of India, when she stood more indeed of the proffered aid of government, to raise her from the degraded state into which she has fallen, and dispel the prevailing ignorance which so unhappily pervades the land. 24. At a former period, I recollect, that the government, on the recommendation of the College Board, authorised the late Mr Ross, then Collector in the neighbouring district of Cuddapah, to establish experimental schools with the view of improving the education of the natives; but the lamented death of that zealous and able public officer led to the abandonment of a plan, to which his talents and popularity in the country were peculiarly calculated to give success. As Secretary to the college, and to your Board, I was, at that time, a warm advocate for such experi­ment; and, if now allowed, I should gladly attempt to superintend some arrangement of that kind, in my present provincial situa­tion. 25. I would propose the appointment of an able Shastry from amongst the Law students at the college, with an addition to his existing pay of only 10 pagodas per mensem, to be placed under me at the principal station of the district, to instruct gratuitous­ly all who chose to attend him, in the Hindoo sciences in the Sanscrit language, and the native school masters, in the grammar of the Teloogoo and Carnataca tongues, being those vernacular here; such a man I have no doubt that I could soon obtain from the college; for, if one with all the requisite qualifications is not at present attached to the institution, there are many that I know there who can speedily qualify themselves for it in a very short time. 26. Subordinate to this man and liable to his periodical visita­tions, I would recommend that seventeen school masters, for Teloogoo and Carnataca, be entertained, at from 7 to 14 rupees each per mensem to be stationed at the seventeen Cusba stations under each of my Amildars, and liable to their supervision, to teach gratuitously these languages. Their lowest pay might be fixed at 7 rupees, and might be raised, by fixed gradations, with the increasing number of their scholars, as high as the maximum above stated. All of these might be selected from the best in­formed of the present school masters here; but, with reference to the low state of knowledge amongst the present persons of that class, most of them will previously require instruction from the Head Shastry, in gram{3}, etc. Though forbidden to demand money all such masters should be allowed to receive any presents their scholars may offer to them; particularly those usual, on entering or quitting school. 27. The highest expense of such an institution would be 273 rupees, the lowest 154 rupees per mensem. The first expense must necessarily be borne by government, who alone are able to origi­nate, and, at first support, such a plan. But proper steps may be taken to engage in it the aid of the more opulent classes of the community, and if practicable to induce them, in due time, will­ingly to contribute to the support of such schools. Indeed, I have little doubt that the plan would soon carry with it the united consent, and grateful approbation, of the more respectable and well informed of the inhabitants at large. 28. It would also greatly accelerate the progress and efficiency of such schools, if Government were to appropriate a moderate annual sum, to the purpose of preparing and printing, at the college press, or elsewhere, suitable books for the use of these schools, in the prose, or common, dialects, of the Teloogoo and Carnataca languages; on the principle stated by me in a former part of this letter. These should consist of selections from the most approved native school books, fables, proverbs, etc., now in use in the schools or well known in the country to the exclusion, in the first instance, of all new publications whatever. Books of a popular and known character, intelligible to all who read, would thus be procurable at a cheaper rate, and in more correct state, than at present, and the teachers might be employed to dispose of them at low prices. 29. If public examinations once a year were instituted before the Head Shastry, and small premiums of badges of distinction were distributed, for the purpose of rewarding, on such occasions, those who are most advanced, a suitable effect might be produced, and a powerful stimulus afforded to the students. 30. To cover the first expense of these schools, and to provide further for their gradual extension, if found, advisable, without entailing any additional or new expense on government, it might be provided, that, on the demise of any persons now holding Yeomiahs or alienated lands, a new inquiry be instituted; and that, though the same may have been continued for more than one generation by the British Government, it be resumed, and carried to a new fund, to be termed the school ‘fund’ (to which the proposed expense should also be debited), unless it is clearly stated that the body of the original grant to be ‘hereditary’, on the intention of the ruling power at the time to make such grant hereditary, be clearly proved to the satisfaction of government. 31. If an arrangement of this kind is sanctioned, I have little doubt that, in a few years, the receipts from such a fund would more than counterbalance the disbursement. But even if they did not, the charge would be comparatively trifling. The enactments of the British Parliament contemplate such a charge. The known liberality of the authorities in England on this subject ensure to it sanction: the supreme government have set the example; and, the Provincial functionaries in the Madras territories ought perhaps to take blame to themselves; that they have waited to be called upon, before they stood forth as the organ of public opinion, in a matter of such importance and universal interest; I sincerely hope that it will not, as before, be allowed to sink into oblivion; but that the information submitted by the several Collectors, will enable your Board and the government, to mature, from their suggestions, some practical, or at least some experi­mental plan for the improvement of education, and the support of learning in Southern India.

In particular a shift is highlighted between Kātyāyaṇa’s (third century BCE) integrative approach (vacana) and Patañjali’s (second century BCE) recourse to implicit paribhāṣās in the Aṣṭādhyāyī as a powerful hermeneutical tool.

The principal issue here is: do apaśabdas directly signify meanings for Sistas when they communicate with someone using a vernacular, or do these speakers esort to a translation technique such that the apaśabda used calls to mind a sadhuśabda, which then directly signifies a meaning? This topic also involves another important question: how one should consider the Vrtti and other commentaries in relation to what is said in the karika text.},

I did myself the honour to write to Sir Charles Mallet, who had resided many years in {India}, and who obligingly onfirmed to me that the report, that this had been a common operation in {India}, from time immemorial; adding, that it had always been performed by the caste of brickmakers, and, that though not invariably, it was usually successful. Mr. James Stuart Hall, a gentleman who was many years in {India}, assured me, that he had seen the operation performed, and that it was of tedious length. From Dr. Barry, of the India service, I learned that he also had seen the operation; that it occupied an hour and a half, and was perfomed with an old razor, the edge of which, being continually blunted in dissection, was every moment re-set. Tow was introduced to support the nose, but no attempt to form nostrils, by adding a septum, was made. I am obligingly informed by Major Heitland, of the India service, that in {India}, several years ago, in the time of Hyder Ali, Mr. Lucas, an English surgeon, was, in several instances, successful in the operation, which he copied from the Hindoo practitioners. Boyer mentions, that the late M. Chopart once employed, in a manner, as it seems, similar to the Indian, a portion of the integuments of the neck, to fill up a void space, left by the operation for a cancerous lip\ldots . [p.100, appendix II:] Since the preceeding sheets have passed the press, some additional facts, regarding the {Indian} operation, and particularly the case of Cowasjee, have come to my knowledge. Lieutenant-Colonel Ward, of the India service, but at this time resident in London, was the commanding officer of Cowasjee, at the time when the latter was mutilated by the order of Tippoo Sultan, and also witnessed the operation performed for restoring the nose. This gentleman has done me the honour to communicate the following particulars. Cowasjee and four other native soldiers, were made prisoners by the marauding party of Tippoo Sultan. The enemy cut off the hands and noses of all the five, and then sent them back to the English, with leaves bound over the stumps oftheir arms, to stop the bleeding, but with the remains of their noses as they were left by the knife. In this deplorable state, they entered Poonah. The wounds were healed, and pensions granted to the unhappy sufferers. Some time had elapsed, when, one day, at Poonah, a native merchant came to the house of Sir Charles Warre Malet, the British resident at that city, offering for sale oil-cloth, and stating his place of residence to be four hundred miles from Poonah. A cicatrix or scar being observed on the centre of the merchant's nose, he was asked how he came by it; upon which he showed another scar on his forehead, and explained the operation he had undergone. He confessed, that he had been deprived of his nose by the executioner, as a punishment for adultery; and added, that his new one was the work of an artist ho lived where he resided, and who frequently did the ame for others. Upon receiving this account, and immediately thinking of Cowasjee and his fellows, Sir Charles Malet caused the operator to come to Poonah, where he gave new noses to all the five. It was understood at Poonah, that this operator was the only one in India; but that the art had been hereditary in his family, as we have seen it described in that of the Boianis or Boianos of Calbria, and in that of Branca in Sicily. At page 41, I have proposed the question, whether the {Indian} operators, like the ancient ones in Europe, practised the restoration of the lips and ears, as well as that of the nose. The following letter, addressed to me by Colonel Ward, gives a decided answer as to the lips; the artist who came to Poonah having expressed a wish to operate on the eldest son of the British native-ambassador at the Paishwah's court, who had lost part of his upper lip, but who, it appears, did not submit to the experiment: (COPY.) DEAR SIR, In consequence of the conversation I had with you last night about Cowasjee, who had a nose put on at Poonah, in th epresene of Mr Uhthoff and myself, when we belonged to the suite of the late Sir Charles Warre Malet, then ambassador at the above court, I eg to inform you, that the same people who put on the nose said, they were also in the habit of putting on lips; and wanted to perform that operation on the eldest son of our native ambassador at the Paishwah's court, who had lost part of his upper lip: but to this he would not although they told him they agree, had frequently done it with success. I am, Dear Sir, Your obedient humble Servant, J. WARD. November 12th, 1815. MR. CARPUE. [Gaspar Taliacozzo, Bologna, 1546--99: pioneer of nose repairs.] On pp. 36--38, Carpue reproduces the text from the Gentleman's Magazine, but has ``Findlay" for ``Trindlay" (p.37). He also says, ``The same account was subsequently engraved under a tetached portrait of Cowasjee, in which, as in the frmer, the new nose and cicatrix are marked. This portrait is engraved by Mr. W. Nutter, from a painting by Mr. James Wales, of Bombay; and published in London in the year 1793." p. 38 ``Pennant, in his View of Hindoostan, printed in 1798, gives a second description of this practice: \ldots The Hircarrah, or Madras Gazette, of August 5th, 1794, informs us, that Cowasjee, two years before, fell under the displeasure of Tippoo Sultan\ldots. This art is practised by the Koomas, a caste of Hindoos.\footnote{Pennant's View of Hindoostan, 2vols. 4to. 1798, Vol.II, page 237.}" -- p. 39. [Carpue describes, pp. 81--90 (case I), his operation imitating the {Indian} method, performed on 23 October, 1814. The operation lasted a quarter of an hour (p.86), excluding bandaging. 37 mins in all. `On the third day, I took off the dressings\ldots. and I had the high satisfaction to hear the officer, before alluded to, exclaim, from the foot of the bed, ``My G--d, there \emph{is} a nose!" Illustrated by plate 3, facing p.88.]},

From a sociocultural perspective what must be explained is not just the fact of varying cultures and societies, but also the human capacity to create, maintain and alter social forms over time. From a biological perspective we have to ask, what is the selective advantage of such variability? The answer lies in human sociality. Sociality consists in a package of social intellectual capacities-higher order intentionality, pedagogy, narrativity, crativity, speech-which made possible an increasing division of labour. But as these capacities grew, they gave rise to distinctively human (rather than Darwinian) history, that is to the forms of social, political, economic and cultural causation which create ever new variations on the theme of social existence.},

Mental disorders have known environmental causes, but there is heterogeneity in the response to each causal factor, which gene–environment findings attribute to genetic differences at the DNA sequence level. Such findings come from epidemiology, an ideal branch of science for showing that gene–environment interactions exist in nature and affect a significant fraction of disease cases. The complementary discipline of epidemiology, experimental neuroscience, fuels gene–environment hypotheses and investigates underlying neural mechanisms. This article discusses opportunities and challenges in the collaboration between psychiatry, epidemiology and neuroscience in studying gene–environment interactions.},

It addresses the mythical figure of Europe that is often taken to be the original site of the modern in many histories of capitalist transition in non-Western countries. This imaginary Europe, Chakrabarty argues, is built right into the social sciences. The very idea of historicizing carries with it some peculiarly European assumptions about disenchanted space, secular time, and human sovereignty. Measured against such mythical standards, capitalist transition in the third world has often seemed either incomplete or lacking. Chakrabarty finds that "Nativism," however, is no answer to Eurocentrism, because the universals propounded by European Enlightenment remain indispensable to any social critique that seeks to address issues of social justice and equity. <i>Provincializing Europe</i> proposes that every case of transition to capitalism is a case of translation as well--a translation of existing worlds and their thought-categories into the categories and self-understandings of capitalist modernity. Chakrabarty demonstrates, both theoretically and with examples from colonial and contemporary India, how such translational histories may be thought and written. <i>Provincializing Europe</i> is not a project of shunning European thought. It is a project of globalizing such thought by exploring how it may be renewed both for and from the margins.</p>} {Can European thought be dislodged from the center of the practice of history in a non-European place?

It covers areas such as the integration of archaeology with narratives of early Indian history; the trajectories of social change and social formation; the historical position of ideology and its shifts; and, importantly, how ways of communicating knowledge of the past is now increasingly under non-academic fundamentalist onslaught. 'Studying Early India' also investigates the profound impact of colonialism on the study of India's early past, the new methods and premises introduced into India by colonial studies and the variety of departures from traditional, pre-colonial modes of history-writing. This new book on the methodological changes that confront the historian of pre-colonial India will consolidate Professor Chattopadhyaya's reputation as one of the foremost thinkers in his area of ancient and early medieval history.},

  abstract         = {The ancient ritual drink used in religious ceremonies and known as soma in India and ashaoma in the Zoroastrian tradition is praised in the highest terms—as a kind of deity—in both Zoroastrian and Vedic texts, which date from around 1,700–1,500 BCE. It is said to provide health, power, wisdom and even immortality. Many theories have been published about the possible botanical identity of this ‘nectar of immortality’, a plant which appears to have psychedelic/entheogenic properties.

Matthew Clark spent several years researching and travelling widely in his quest of soma. In his fascinating, original and highly readable book, this modern explorer of ancient wisdom reviews scholarly research, explores mythology and ritual and shares his extensive knowledge of psychoactive plants and fungi. The author suggests that the visionary soma drink was based on analogues of ayahuasca, using a variety of plants, some of which can now be identified.

Author: Dr. Matthew Clark is a Research Associate at the School of Oriental and African Studies (University of London), where he has taught courses on Hinduism. He has spent many years in India, which he first visited in 1977. He first engaged with yoga in the mid-1970s and lectures regularly on yoga and philosophy. His publications include The Daśanāmī-Saṃnyāsīs: The Integration of Ascetic Lineages into an Order (2006), which is a study of a sect of sādhus, and a short book on the origins and practices of yoga (2007). He is also a song-writer and musician (Mahabongo).},

The reference clearly is to the coming of the Zoroastrian sun-worshippers from Persia to India. Maga has been taken as the Mahabhārata reading for the name of the Brahman caste of Śākadvīpa, and Śākadvīpa has, apparently, been brought into connection with the Śakas. All the texts, however, which relate to these Śākadvīpīya Brahmans are too late to have any bearing on the problem of the origin of the name, or on the problem of the original location of Śākadvīpa.109 "},

Observational and calculational knowledge existed in all of the major world regions before Europe of the 1600s; p.533:\ldots late [mathematical] texts such as Boethius' ommitted the proofs that constituted the main Greek achievement in abstract mathematics. p.542: There is another, very different structural change in the bases of intellecutal life: displacement of the Church from control of the central means of intellecutal production. p.551: India.\ldots ``Organizationally, the mathematicians, astronomers, and medical doctors werebased in private familistic lineages and guilds, never part of the sustained argument provided by philosophical networks. Public networks of argument did exist in India; its philosophical lineages reached high levels of abstract development. Only mathematics and science were not carried along with it. p.535: What then are the social conditions which brought about this combination of rapid research front plus consensus on older results? One possibility is empiricism. Many kinds of organized empiricism had developed in Europe by the 1600s. [Vesalius 1543, Tycho Brahe 1576--1600]. But the difference between Eruopean rapid-discovery science and trditional science is not a matter of empiricism. Traditional science is essentially empirical. [China, Albert the Great\ldots ] What else is needed? Two other possibilites are \emph{research technology} and \emph{mathematics}.},

Opened with two fingers, it causes the love-juice to flow -- this tube and the sunshade of the Love God (vagina and clitoris) are the two organs characteristic of the woman. The Sunshade of the Love God is a nose-shaped organ placed just above the entrance of the God's dwelling, and full of the veins which secrete the juice of love. Not far from it, within the vulva, is a duct pūrnacandrā (full moon), which also is filled with this juice (Bartholin's duct?). There is also another vascular area (the vestibule?): when these three zones are rubbed with the finger, the woman is brought into condition."},

  abstract  = {This article is about the historical memory of Alexander the Great in the Delhi Sultanate and how his figure was emblematic of a trans-regional Persianate culture. Amir Khusrau’s largely overlooked Persian epic Āyina’i sikandarī (The Mirror of Alexander) (1302) depicts Alexander the Great as an exemplary Persian emperor who reused material cultures from around the world to produce inventions such as his eponymous mirror and the astrolabe. Through Alexander, Khusrau envisions the Persian emperor as an agent of trans-cultural patronage, reuse and repurpose. Roughly 60 years after Khusrau’s death, the poet’s theory of Alexander’s Persianate material patronage was put into practice by the Delhi Sultan Firuz Shah Tughluq (r. 1351–88), who claimed to have discovered Alexander’s astrolabe and then used the instrument to adorn the Delhi-Topra pillar, the centrepiece of his new capital Firuzabad. Citations of Khusrau’s epic in a contemporary chronicle help us see how Khusrau’s imagination of ancient Persian Empire framed a practice of organising different styles of material culture into an imperial bricolage. The article concludes with some implications of this research for defining Persianate culture in general.},

  abstract         = {Toward the end of the Banārsı̄ Vilās, the collected works of Banārsı̄dās (1586-1643) that was compiled by his colleague Jagjı̄vanrām in 1644, there is a curious seven-caupāı̄ composition entitled Gorakhnāth ke Vacan, or The Sayings of Gorakhnāth. The text, which may or may not have been authored by Banārsı̄dās, but at the very least provides us with a Jain reception of Gorakhnāths teachings, gives a very favorable short summary of them. To the best of my knowledge, no scholarly attention has been focused on this text. Scholars of Banārsı̄dās at best simply mention it in passing. Scholars of Gorakhnāth, and the Nāths seem largely to be ignorant of the text. A century later, in his Mokṣa-mārg Prakāśak, the Jaipur-based Terāpanth ideologue Ṭoḍarmal (ca. 1719/20-1766/67) included a discussion of the practices of Haṭha Yogı̄s, who most likely were Rāmānandı̄s. His comments were harshly critical of these false practices. Neither account of these Hindu Yogic practitioners of early modern north India is sufficiently extensive or detailed to provide useful contemporary evidence of the details of the practices of these Yogic groups. They do, however, show us two very different responses to the problem of religious diversity. While Banārsı̄dās affirms the superiority of the Jain teachings in other texts, the inclusion of Gorakhnāth ke Vacan in his Banārsı̄ Vilās shows that he was a curious spiritual seeker, who could find value in non-Jain practices and ideas. Ṭoḍarmal, on the other hand, was a staunch ideologue, who exalted the Jain doctrines and denigrated all others.},

  abstract = {This article concerns the issue of cultural re-framing of a work from a distant time and place. I look at two translations of Kalidasa's poem Meghaduta, “The Cloud Messenger.” The first, published by Horace Wilson in 1814, was a highly assimilative translation but was very intelligently framed in Wilson's introduction and extensive annotations to make the poem legible to readers of the Greek and Roman classics while bringing out cultural difference. My second example, by the American translator Leonard Nathan in 1976, is a much better translation but actually a less successful cultural re-framing, as Nathan's introduction and notes play down the poem's violence and eroticism in order to give the poem a quasi-New-Critical balance and harmony. In discussing these translations, I ask how they work for readers with no knowledge of Sanskrit or of ancient Indian culture, using the translations to suggest ways in which readers can negotiate radical cultural/temporal difference.},

The tragedy invited a Supreme Court suo motu intervention against local healing shrines all over the country that also included reform of the mental health system in general. This set of medico-legal events has led to the exclusive targeting of local healing shrines by various statutory agencies evoking human rights, ignoring the primary intent of the court that was reform of the mental health system in general. Against this context, we are presenting case studies of dargahs in Maharashtra which serve the purpose of healing from psychosocial traumas and argue for a more deliberate response to the vexed question of mental healing and overall health.},

This groundbreaking work describes the genesis of the Tantric movement in early medieval India, where it developed as a response to, and in some ways an example of, the feudalization of Indian society. Drawing on primary documents -many translated for the first time -from Sanskrit, Prakrit, Tibetan, Bengali, and Chinese, Ronald Davidson shows how changes in medieval Indian society, including economic and patronage crises, a decline in women�s participation, and the formation of large monastic orders, led to the rise of the esoteric tradition in India that became the model for Buddhist cultures in China, Tibet, and Japan.

  abstract  = {Most models on the origins of tantrism have been either inattentive to or dismissive of non-literate, non-sectarian ritual systems. Groups of magicians, sorcerers or witches operated in India since before the advent of tantrism and continued to perform ritual, entertainment and curative functions down to the present. There is no evidence that they were tantric in any significant way, and it is not clear that they were concerned with any of the liberation ideologies that are a hallmark of the sectarian systems, even while they had their own separate identities and specific divinities. This paper provides evidence for the durability of these systems and their continuation as sources for some of the ritual and nomenclature of the sectarian tantric traditions, including the predisposition to ritual creativity and bricolage.},

  abstract         = {The collection of Malayalam records entitled Vanjeri Grandhavari, taken from the archives of an important Namputiri Brahmin family and the temple under its leadership, provides some long-awaited information regarding a wide range of legal activities in late medieval Kerala. The organization of law and the jurisprudence represented by these records bear an unmistakable similarity to legal ideas found in dharmasastra texts. A thorough comparison of the records and relevant dharma texts shows that landholding Namputiri Brahmins, who possessed enormous political and economic power in the region, mediated the implementation of dharmasastra into the legal system. From this comparison arise new understandings of law and legal categories such as `custom' and `positive law'. Moreover, such comparisons begin to elucidate the problems involved in Western assumptions that it is textual law, not its interpretation and application by humans, which controls behavior. The Vanjeri records demonstrate not only the importance of dharmasastra as a historical document but also the manner and extent to which dharmasastra provided the foundation for legal systems in Kerala as well as in other regions of India.},

  abstract         = {Abstract Playing of sedentary games with dice and playing board games have had a major role in the Indian culture since at least 3000 BCE. This is shown by archaeological sites and early literary references in the Rig-Veda, Mahabharata and other texts. Some of these games have survived in the form of boards, game pieces, dice and cards. Apart from actual sets, the traces of board games can also be found in Hindu rock cut temples. These sculptures and paintings appear across the medieval period. The list is exhaustive. The game play also finds its presence on numerous temple floorings, carved or inscribed. Why would somebody carve these board games on these spaces? Interestingly, throughout history, some board games have increased its popularity, and some have disappeared from artistic expressional record. How did one board game overtake the other in terms of its popularity in the later phases of history? What made these games socially acceptable and popular? Where were these games played? What was the space context? The paintings dominantly show royal houses, court rooms as spaces. Were there special pavilions used for game playing by Indian royals? In India board games were traditionally played at ground level. With growing European influence in the subcontinent in the 18th century, local elites adopted the western custom of elevated furniture for board games. Did this change the space context? The paper thus tries to evolve parameters to analyze the impact of board games on spaces and would throw light on the “space context” with reference to Indian board games tracing it to the contemporary time.},

  abstract         = {This paper deals with the history of the disputes regarding the Ksatriya status of the local ruler Shivaji and the Cāndrasenīya Kāyastha Prabhu (CKP) community of Maharashtra. The origin of these disputes lies in the wider dispute concerning whether there are any true Ksatriyas in the Kali age. The CKPs of Maharashtra claimed to be Ksatriyas and thus entitled for the rite of Upanayana, while the dominant regional Brahmin opinion was that they were Śūdras and not entitled for the Upanayana. The dispute broke out a few years before Shivaji's coronation, and to the discomfort of the local Brahmins, Gāgābhatta of Banaras settled it in favor of the Kāyasthas in his work, the Kāyasthadharmadīpa. In decades after Shivaji's death, the dispute broke out again, and within Maharashtra, gradually the Dharmaśāstric opinion shifted against the views of Gāgābhatta, and toward the end of the rule of the last Peshwa, this dispute was raised again by Nīlakantha Śāstri Thatte in Pune against the Kāyasthas. I have traced the lineage of Nīlakantha Thatte, through his teacher Vaidyanātha Pāyagunde, to his teacher, the great Nāgeśabhatta of Banaras. Nāgeśsabhatta produced his Vrātyatāprāyaścittanirnaya at a śāastrasabhā in Jaipur, where he argued that there were no pure Ksatriyas surviving in the Kali age, and that the impure ones do not have the eligibility for Upanayana through some expiation. So the Kāyasthas could not claim to be genuine Ksatriyas either. It was this opinion of Nāgesabhatta, counter to the opinion of Gāgābhatta, that steadily gained popularity among the Pune Brahmins during the rule of the Peshwas, finally reflected in the activities of Nīlakantha Thatte.},

  abstract         = {Although in Chinese culture surgery has not usually been seen as a major part of medical practice, during the Sui (A.D. 581--618) and the Tang dynasties (A.D. 618--907), it showed a marked flowering in the field of ophthalmology. Chinese historical records, popular literature and medical works and compilations indicate that it was closely related to Indian medicine. The origins of this transmission can be traced to early Chinese Buddhist canonical literature. Chinese and Indian ophthalmological works of the time are studied here, especially ophthalmic diseases like pterygium, entropion or trichiasis and cataract, which often call for surgical intervention as a way of giving curative or palliative treatment. The texts reflect upon the origin, route and nature of this transmission, and vividly depict the gradual introduction of various aspects of surgery into Chinese medicine. Indian medicine was thus a prominent contributor to the development of Chinese medicine and, especially, surgery from the seventh century A.D. onwards.},

Part II looks at the work of later sociologists, who make up a different category: Those who take into account and narrate the historical background of the social reality that constitutes their research. This paper lays stress on the necessity of a ``substantive" use of history for sociological purposes. It takes particular note of those sociologists who have used history rigorously to arrive at broader levels of explanation, generalisation and theoretical abstraction, in the process thereby ensuring a "completion" of their sociological mission. It is this process that needs to be further exploited by present day sociologists. [This is the concluding part of the paper; the first part was published last week.]},

It also critically assesses the rigour with which a reconstruction of past events and experiences has been attempted so as to understand and explain the present in sociological studies in India. While reviewing seminal writings of scholars who used Indology extensively, as also those of sociologists who have attempted systematic use of history in macroanalysis, this paper focuses attention on contributions of Indian sociologists who have used the historical method rigorously in rural studies, as also in studies of social movements, agrarian structure and change, caste and analysis of industrial and urban settings. Finally, it distinguishes between “metaphoric” and “substantive” use of history and opines that the real potential of historical sociology lies in the latter. It also expresses optimism that despite the initial indifference of Indian sociologists towards history, they are now rediscovering their discipline’s roots in history and are also realising its intrinsic value in generating, what Earnest Nagel (1961) called, “historical explanation”. [The second and concluding part will be published next week.]},

The study of travel writing has, however, remained either naively celebratory or dismissive, treating texts as symptoms of imperial ideologies.<br> <br> <b></b><b><i>Imperial Eyes</i></b> explores European travel and exploration writing, in connection with European economic and political expansion since 1700. It is both a study in genre, and a critique of ideology. Pratt examines how travel books by Europeans create the domestic subject of European imperialism, and how they engage metropolitan reading publics with expansionist enterprises whose material benefits accrued mainly to the very few. These questions are addressed through readings of particular travel accounts connected with particular historical transitions, from the eighteenth century to Paul Theroux: sentimental travel writing and its links with abolitionist rhetoric, discursive reinventions of South America during the period of its independence (1800--1840), and eighteenth-century European writings on Southern Africa in the context of inland expansion.</P>}},

  abstract  = {This book is a collection of forty-three essays on Hinduism, arranged logically rather than chronologically, and designed specifically for an Indian audience. The author focuses on topics that contradict what most people believe about Hinduism, from women and animals to heresy, dharma, and karma. She talks about the nature of Hinduism and defines what Hinduism is, particularly its pluralism and threats to Hindu pluralism. She also reflects on several of the enduring central themes of Hinduism, all of which involve karma, birth, death, and rebirth. In addition, she explores concepts of divinity, from the material and immaterial aspects of god to the changing role of the gods in creation and in sacrifice, disputes over the sexual nature of god, and the grace of god. Other topics covered by the book include Hindu attitudes toward gender, particularly Manu’s attitude towards women in general, as well as stories about several individual females, sexuality, desire and the control of desire in Hinduism, the bestial aspects of human nature, the tension between miscegenation and incest, and the rise of Hindu supremacy in India.},

This essay seeks to address this issue in three parts. First, I present the South Asian standpoint as it currently relates to the science and religion discourse. Second, I survey and evaluate some available literature on South Asian approaches to the science and religion discourse. Finally, I promote three possible steps forward: (1) the literature must shift from high Hindu philosophical religion to the more prevalent bhakti traditions, (2) the Indian context must be understood in its own right without metaphysical assumptions attached to the concepts of science and religion, and (3) most importantly, concepts unique to the Indian worldview, such as dharma, maya, and cit, must receive better treatment in translation in order to facilitate a more accurate exchange of ideas across cultural boundaries.},

  abstract         = {The term jangal in contemporary Pakistan refers to, ``forest." Its etymological antecedent, the Sanskrit term jangala, referred to ``savanna." Francis Zimmermann argues that the change in meaning is a historical ``misunderstanding. " It is argued here, on the contrary, that the change in meaning accurately reflects a fundamental, historical alteration of relations between culture and nature. The economy of the early pastoral societies of this part of the subcontinent was based on transforming the region's natural thorn forest into an anthropogenic savanna. During the succeeding millennia, as the result of intensification of land-use patterns in response to demographic and political pressures, the culturally desirable jangala ``savanna" became transformed into the culturally undesirable jangal ``forest waste. " This transformation in both physical environment and cultural values was the product of a dialectical relationship between nature and culture. For reasons of self-interest, state governments have a history of obfuscating and not recognizing this relationship.},

When the Emperor began to descend the steps of the stair from the terrace, the crier, according to custom, proclaimed the time of prayer. The King, conformably to the practice of religion, stood still upon this occasion and repeated his creed, then sat down upon the second stair till the proclamation was ended. When he was going to rise, he supported himself on a staff, which unfortunately slipped upon the marble, and the King fell headlong from the top to the bottom of the stair: he was taken up insensible, and laid upon his bed; he soon recovered his speech, and the physicians administered all their art, but in vain; for upon the 11th of the month, about sun-set, his soul took her flight to Paradise. He was buried in the new city upon the banks of the river, and a noble tomb was erected over him some years after by his son Akber. Humayun died at the age of fifty-one, after a reign of twenty-five years in Kabul and India." \\ Another tr., \emph{History of the Rise of Mahommedan Power in India Ferishta}, v.ii, pp.177--178, at http://persian.packhum.org/ persian/pf?file=06901022\&ct=33\\ probably this is \cite[ii, 177--8]{brig-hist}},

Few editors, however, in particular those working with manuscript or early printed materials, are content simply to record the one and ignore the other. There is, moreover, a great range of ‘accidentals’ which one may or may not want to include in a transcription. At one end of the spectrum there are transcriptions which may be called strictly diplomatic, in which every feature which may reasonably be reproduced in print is retained. These features include not only spelling and punctuation, but also capitalization, word division and variant letter forms. The layout of the page is also retained, in terms of line-division, large initials, etc. Any abbreviations in the text will not be expanded, and, in the strictest diplomatic transcriptions, apparent slips of the pen will remain uncorrected.},

But we do not thereby know, or at least may not know (i.e., do not \emph{know}) what Aristarchus meant unless we know the ontological and physical contexts at the very least which gave definition to his claim. Rudely, what we know is that Aristarchus anticipated one of our more firmly established beliefs. But this is self-celebratory gibberish, not history. It is a poor attempt at understanding Aristarchus.\end{quote} 91--2: historical explanation needs two parts: a causal story (= social history) and a philosophical analysis of the ideas.\\ 92: \begin{quote}Men, breathing, excreting, hating, mocking\ldots \end{quote}\\ 103, n.18: \begin{quote}\ldots enunciated with the plummy self-assurance of a well-fed agnostic in a role which is religious only as an inconvenient historical hangover.\end{quote}\\ 98:\begin{quote}The history of philosophy, like the history of science, must needs be Whig as to subject matter, just as, like all history, it must be Tory as to truth.\end{quote} Meaning that the topics of the past selected for study must be philosophically interesting today.\\ 98: \begin{quote} The problem of interpretation is alwasy the problem of closing the context.\end{quote}},

It is argued that vrātya elements in pravargya include Rudra as Mahāvīra (a heroic character, also an epithet of the vessel containing the offering), the sattra (collective ritual) setting of the paradigm myth, the motif of the unstrung bow, the minimal presence of females in pravargya, and divinisation of man as a goal of the ritual. The superhuman status attributed to the Mahāvīra is comparable with that of Atharvavedic characters like the vrātya and the brahmacārin (celibate student); the affinity between these figures may be derived from a common ascetic ideology, the roots of which some are to be sought in the warrior society.},

  abstract     = {This article explores how plague—as an idea—became an ahistorical independent agent of historical change. It focuses on the case of the Justinianic Plague (ca. 541–750 c.e.), the first major recorded plague pandemic in Mediterranean history, which has increasingly been used to explain significant demographic, political, social, economic, and cultural change during late antiquity (ca. 300–800 c.e.). We argue that the Justinianic Plague retains its great historiographic power—namely, its supposed destructive impact over two centuries—because it evokes a terrifying myth of what plague should do rather than because of conclusive evidence of what it did. We define this historiographic power as the plague concept. It includes three key features: extensive chronology (lasting for two centuries), mortality (catastrophic death toll), and geography (global). The plague concept is built on three interdisciplinary types of evidence (here termed truisms): rats, climate, and paleogenetics. Our article traces how scientists constructed the plague concept in the first half of the twentieth century, and how historians entered the discussion in the last third of that century. As historians engaged in Justinianic Plague research, they used the plague concept to frame their arguments without problematizing its presence or contesting features that scientists had constructed decades earlier.},

This chapter looks at two key turns in the historiography of science that have focused on the role of translation. It begins by tracing some of the ways in which ideas about translation shaped early histories of the “Arabic sciences” in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It then considers some of the more recent literature on translation and the history of science, focusing on antique to early modern sciences in East Asia in particular. Using these case studies, it considers a variety of historiographical, methodological, and analytical themes raised by bringing together ideas and practices of translation studies with the history of science.},

  abstract         = {Are the standards of reasoning and rationality in divination, religious practice, and textual exegesis different from those in the sciences? Can there be different standards of reasoning and rationality at all? The intense “rationality debate” of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s focused on these questions and the related problems of relativism across cultures and systems of practice. Although philosophers were at the center of these debates at the time, they may appear to have abandoned the question in recent years. On the contrary, I discuss recent developments in philosophy that approach the issue from a number of new directions, changing our understanding of reasoning and rationality. I argue that, in comparing the diviner with the scientist, focusing on reasoning is likely to be a red herring. Instead, I argue that a careful treatment of rationality, paying particular attention to its context dependence, untangles longstanding confusions. Moreover, it points the way forward to investigating modest but interesting ways for there to be alternative standards of rationality.},

  abstract  = {This volume examines notions of health and illness in North Indian devotional culture, with particular attention paid to the worship of the goddess Sitala, the Cold Lady. Consistently portrayed in colonial and postcolonial literature as the ambiguous 'smallpox goddess', Sitala is here discussed as a protector of children and women, a portrayal that emerges from textual sources as well as material culture.

The eradication of smallpox did not pose a threat to Sitala and her worship. She continues to be an extremely popular goddess. Religion, Devotion and Medicine in North India critically examines the rise and affirmation of the 'smallpox myth' in India and beyond, and explains how Indian narratives, ritual texts and devotional songs have celebrated Sitala as a loving mother who protects her children from the effects, and the fear, of poxes, fevers and infantile disorders but also all sorts of new threats (such as global pandemics, addictions and environmental catastrophes). The book explores a wide range of ritual and devotional practices, including scheduled festivals, songs, vows, pageants, austerities, possession, animal sacrifices and various forms of offering.

Built on extensive fieldwork and a close textual analysis of sources in Sanskrit and vernacular languages (Hindi, Bhojpuri and Bengali) as well as on a rich bibliography on the struggle against smallpox in colonial and post-colonial India, the book reflects on the ambiguous nature of Sitala as a phenomenon largely dependent on the enduring fascination with the exotic, and the horrific, that has pervaded public renditions of Indian culture in indigenous fiction, colonial reports, medical literature and now global culture.},

  abstract         = {Traditional knowledge is a very broad deﬁnition which embraces technical concepts about a local environment, wherein said knowledge derives from the long-standing traditions and practices of certain regional, indigenous, or local communities. These technical concepts, which are intrinsically connected with the spiritual meanings and beliefs of the communities which had developed them, are the way indigenous people have in order to survive in the surrounding environment. The increasing awareness of the importance of this kind of knowledge brought about the necessity of the deﬁnition, classiﬁcation and legal protection of traditional knowledge. As a consequence, after giving a brief overview of the main legal basis developed in the attempt at the protection of traditional knowledge, this paper deals with the problems associated with the codiﬁcation in registers and databases, and gives some remarks about the Indian, Korean and Chinese traditional knowledge databases. Finally, a case study on a chemical patent search approached from a traditional knowledge point of view is presented. 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In 2014, UPenn was awarded a three-year Preservation and Access Grant (PW-51547-15) from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), entitled “Providing Global Access to Penn’s Indic Manuscripts.” The project was completed in 2017, within the scheduled three-year period for the award. The original terms of the grant stipulated that staff at the Rare Book and Manuscript Library (now absorbed by the Kislak Center) at Penn Libraries was to catalog, rehouse and digitize its Indic manuscript collection, building on efforts from previous years. The collection highlights Penn’s historical commitment to traditional Sanskrit studies and also includes a broad range of vernacular sources including Pali, Prakrit, Hindi, Awadhi, Bengali Marathi, Gujarati, Marwari, Persian, Tamil, and Telugu. In this article I outline some of the recent history leading up to the NEH project, including my own involvement as project cataloger and collection consultant. I will then give an overview of the project and highlight some of its scope, content, and significance. Finally, I will consider some possibilities for promoting the collection in the future.},

  annotation       = {v.1, pp.283-5 talks about Ranjit Dev of Jammu. Talks about "Runzeid Deve" (1, 248-250): \begin{quote} It appears that Jumbo continued to increafe its power and commerce until the year 1770, the period of Runzeid Deve's death, when one of his sons, the prefent chief, contrary to the intention and express will of his father, seized on the government, put to death one of his brothers, the intended successor, and imprisoned another; who having made his escape sought the protection of the Sicques. Pleased in having obtained so favourable a pretext for entering Jumbo, which they attempted in vain during the administration of Runzeid Deve, the Sicques promised to espouse the fugitive's cause with vigour. A small sum had been annually exacted by them from Jumbo, but in a much less proportion than what was levied in the adjacent territories. The Sicques, indeed aware of the respetable date of the Jumbo force, and the ability of the chief were contented with the name of tribute. The most valuable division of the Jumbo districts, lay in the plain country, forming part of the northern Punjab; which, under pretence of affording assistance to the perfon who lately sought their protection, a body of Sicques have laid waste. They are now prosecuting a vigorous war against the present chief, who through the defection of many of his people, driven by oppressions to the party of his brother, became unable to make any effectual stand ; and that his ill fortune might be complete, he called into his aid, a party of Sicque mercenaries, commanded by Mhah Sing, a powerful officer in that quarter, who has firmly established his authority at Jumbo, and has erected a fort at the fouth entrance of the principal pass leading into the Punjab. For defraying the expence incurred by the Sicque troops, the Jumbo chief has made vigorous demands on the native inhabitants of the city, and is now throwing an eye on the foreign merchants; who, dreading his dispofition and necessities, have taken a general alarm. It was with much pleasure I saw the person on whom my bill was drawn, a man of a fair and honourable character, enjoying, amidst these disorders, a moderate security. He seemed to have procured the favour of Mhah Sing, who, with other officers of the party, supported him against the designs of the Rajah, The person entrusted with the government of the town of Jumbo, during the absence of the chief then in the field, was fo exact a counterpart of his master % in the system of oppression, that I was advised to a speedy departure lest I should fall under an inspection. Though much fatigued by an harrassing journey, and the sale of my horse, with other necessary concerns, was to be adjusted, such was the ascendency of my fears that on the 16th of the month, I was ready to proceed. \par In laying before you theie scattered pieces of intelligence^ I muffc not forget to notice, that the coortezan^ and female dancers of the Punjab and KaOimire, or rather a mixed breed of both theie countries, are beautiful women, and are held in g^eat eftimation through all the nortliem parts of India : the merchants eftabli(hed at Jumbo, often become (o fondly attached to a dancing giil, that, negleftiog their occupation, they have been known to diffipate, at her will, the whole oi their property 5 and I have feen Ibme of them Tieduced to a fubiiftence on charity -, for thefe girls, in the manner of their profefiion, are profufe and rapacious* Kaftimirian continued \end{quote} Cited by Mridu Rai, Hindu rulers, Muslim subjects: Islam, rights, and the history of Kashmir (Delhi: Permanent Black, 2004), pp.94-5, n.40. (in Google books) Ranjit rules 1750-1781 (p.22) p.22, n.11, refers to an attack on Ranjit Dev by the Bhangis in 1770, one of the most powerful of the Sikh confederacies. Rai cites Charak, A short history of Jammu Raj (Jammu, 1985). Charak, Maharaja Ranjit Dev and the Rise and Fall of Jammu Kingdom, p.118, says that Forster was present during the invasion of Jammu, and cites Forster's account (A Journey, v.1, pp.286 ff.).},

  annotation       = {Cannabis in Western Medicine While the French were the first to begin experimenting with hashish on a relatively large scale, the introduction of cannabis into Western medicine is credited to a now obscure Irish physician, Dr. William Brooke O'Shaughnessy. Although known today for his pioneering experiments with cannabis, during his own lifetime he was best known for introducing intravenous fluid and electrolyte-replacement therapy in the treatment of cholera. His major achievement, however, had nothing at all to do with medicine. Instead, after leaving the medical profession for engineering, O'Shaughnessy was instrumental in introducing the telegraph system into India - an accomplishment for which he was knighted in 1856 by Queen Victoria. O'Shaughnessy retired from military service in 1861 at age fifty-two and returned to England, where for some unknown reason he changed his name to William O'Shaugnessy Brooke\ldots Although he lived for another twenty-eight years, he never returned to medical research and spent his retirement engaged in other activities. O'Shaughnessy first came to India in 1833 as a thirty-year-old surgeon in the employ of the British East India Company. He also held the position of professor of chemistry at the Medical College of Calcutta. Apparently, he became intrigued at cannabis's therapeutic potential almost as soon as he arrived in {India}, and in 1843 he reported a summary of his studies of the drug which so captured the interest of his medical colleagues in England that it was not long before they were clamoring for him to supply them with cannabis for their own medical practices. O'Shaughnessy began his article by observing that while the intoxicating and medicinal effects of cannabis were known throughout the countries of the East, the rug was practically unknown in the West. Following a brief history of the use of the drug in India and in the Arab countries, O'Shaughnessy described the experiments he had conducted on animals, noting an observation that has not since been commented upon nor subjected to further study. In O'Shaughnessy's words, the experiments he had conducted ``led to one remarkable result - That while carnivorous animals, and fish, dogs, cats, swine, vultures and crows, and adjutants, invariably and speedily exhibited the intoxicating influence of the drug, the graminivorous, such as the horse, deer, monkey, goat, sheep, and cow, experienced but trivial effects from any dose we administered." O'Shaughnessy had been nothing if not thorough in his preliminary studies on animals, judging by this statement. Confident that cannabis posed no danger to the well-being of his animal subjects, O'Shaughnessy went on to test its curative potential in some patients who were plagued with rheumatism. After treatment with the drug, O'Shaughnessy found that many reported an easing of their pain and a ``remarkable increase of appetite", ``great mental cheerfulnes", and a feeling of aphrodisia. The capacity to make these patients euphoric led him next to try to alleviate the terrible symptoms associated with rabies in one of his patients. Although the man soon died of the disease, O'Shaughnessy was intrigued to find that the drug did relieve some of the patient's agony and did enable him to swallow some juice and moistened rice. O'Shaughnessy also experimented with cannabis in the treatment of cholera, tetanus, and epilepsy, reporting that in all cases his patients experienced relief from the symptoms of these disorders. When O'Shaughnessy returned to England in 1842, he brought back a quantity of cannabis and turned it over to pharmacist Peter Squire to convert to a form suitable for medical usage. This preparation came to be known as Squire's extract, and launched Squire and his sons into prominence as the main and most reliable suppliers of cannabis extract in England.},

These are only some of the reasons that spices obtained such distinction and ultimately became globally traded products, which in turn helped to develop integrated economic networks. The quest for spice drove not only trade-related globalization, but also helped pave the way for colonialism and global empires. - YaleGlobal},

A blessing not to be passed by without a grateful commemoration, when half the fleet were disabled by distempers acquired by salt meats, and a long voyage without refreshments; and must have suffered too for want of water, had not they met with a seasonable recruit. Care of the sick The first care then was to send the sick men ashore, which it is incredible to relate how strangely they revivifed in so short a time by feeding on oranges and fresh limes, and the very smell of the earth; for those that were carried from the ships in cradles. and looked upon as desperate. in a days time could take up their beds and walk; only minding to fetch them anights.

[predates James Lind, scurvy, 1753] Letter III: A description of Surat and journy (sic) into Duccan. Ch. III (describing matters in Surat, written in 1675), \begin{quote} [p.113] The diseases reign according to the seasons; the north blowing, bodies are rendered firm, solid and active by exhausting the serous humours, \emph{ad Hyp.17. Aph. Lib. 3} for which cause dry weather is [p.114] more healthy than moist, it hastening digestion, and facilitating excretion, when no fevers that are treacherous root themselves in a deep putrefaction. About the variable months they are miserably afflicted with coughts and catarrhs, tumors of the mouth and throat, rheumatisms, and intermitting fevers; also small pox invades the youth, as in all {India}, so here: in the extreme heats, cholera morbus, inflammations of the eyes by dust and the fiery temper of the air; in the rains, fluxes apoplexies, and all distempers of the brain, as well as stomach; to correct which, the natives heat \emph{Hing}, a sort of liquit \emph{Assa F\oe tida}, whereby they smell odiously. For all lethargick fits they use garlick and ginger, given in oyl or butter. Remedies outward and inward. To cup they use \emph{Ventosoes}, without scarificattions. They have good escaroticks and vesicatories, made by a certain nut, the same they chop or mark their Calicuts black with instead of ink. They apply cauteries most unmercifully in a \emph{mordisheen}, called so by the Portugals, being a vomiting with a loossness; the like is done in a calenture. Physic here is now as in former days, open to all pretenders; here being no bars of authority, or formal graduation, examination or proof of their proficiency; but every one ventures, and every one suffers; and those that are most skilled, have it by tradition, or former experience descending in their families; not considering either alteration of tempers or seasons, but what succeeded well to one, they apply to all. In fevers their method is to prescribe coolers, till they have extinguished the vital heat; and if the patients are so robust to conquer the remedies used to quench the flame of the acute disease, yet are they left labouring under chronical ones, as dropsy, jaundice, and ill habits, a long while before they recover their pristine heat. They are unskill'd in anatomy, even those of the \emph{Moors} who follow the \emph{Arabians}, thinking it unlawful to dissect human bodies; whereupon phlebotomy is not understood, they being ignorant how the veins lye; but they will worry themselves martyrs to death by leeches, clapping on an hundred at once, which they know not how to pull off, till they have filled themselves, and drop of their own accord. Chirurgery is in as bad a plight, amputation being an horrid thing: yet I confess it is strange to see, that what nature will effect on such bodies, intemperance has not debauch'd. Pharmacy is in no better condition; apothecaries here being no more than perfumers or druggists, at best; for he that has the boldness to practise, makes up his own medicines, which are generally such draughts, that if their own energy work not, yet the very weight must force an operation. They pretend to understand the pulse, but the urine they will not look on. I have seen a barber undertake the cure of a bloody flux, by pretending the guts were displaced, and laying the patient on his back, and gently tickling his reins, thrust on each side of the \emph{abdomen} [p.115] with all his strength; then placing a pot filled with dried earth like that of \emph{Samos}, upon his navel, he made it fast by a ligature; and on some bodies thus treated he had gained credit, but this died. \emph{PRosper Alpinus} mentions something like this among the \emph{Egyptians}. Here they will submit to spells and charms, and the advice of old women. Here is a \emph{Brachmin} doctor who has raised a good fortune; they pretend to no fees. but make them pay in their physick; and think it honour enough if you favour them with the title of your physician only. This \emph{Brachmin} comes every day, and feels every man's pulse in the factory, and is often made use of for a powder for agues, which works as infallibly as the \emph{Peruvian} bark; it is a preparation of natural cinnaber. Midwifry is in esteem among the rich and lazy only; the poorer, while they are labouring or planting, go aside as if to do their needs, deliver themselves, wash the child, and lay it in a clout or hammock, and return to work again. \end{quote} p.185: A special chorography and history of East-India, chap. VI. Is a summary rehearsal of the whole. \ldots [p.191] \begin{quote} The Brachmins (their men of learning), SCIENCES: Their aptness to learn languages, and skill in philosophy. In esteem among them are principally magick and judicial astrology, one of the sectators of which on all accounts are consulted, as well by moors as Gentues; grammar and rhetorick, some of them being masters of Persian, Indostan, Arabick, Sanscript (or Holy language) Portugueze, and all the depending speeches of Indostan, as Duccany, Moratty, Conchany, and the like; besides the Canatick, in which all their sonnets and poesies are expressed, being softer and more melting than the others; which is an argument also of its antiquity, Indostan not having a character to express itself self in, on which the later dialects depend. Elocution, physick, metaphysicks, are not out of their element: their philosophers maintain an Aristotelian vacuity; nor are they quite ignorant of medicks, though anatomy is not approved, wherein they lean too much on tradition, being able to give a very slender account of the rational part thereof. In what perfection music stands (as I am not competent judge) I could never give my ears the trouble to examine, it seeming loud and barbarous; yet they observe time and measure in their singing and dancing. and are mightily delited with their tumbling and noise. They as much dislike our shriller musick, hardly allowing our wayts fit to play to bears, and our stringed instruments strike not their hard-to-be-raised fancies; but our organs are the musick of the spheres with them, charming them to listen as long as they play. Arithmetick being the most profitable science, is the best understood by them; to which they have a natural propensity and will in a trice, without the help of pen or ink, cast up the difficultest sums, and never pause upon it. In some places they write on cocoe-leafs dried, and then use an iron style; or else on paper, when they use a pen made with a reed for which they have a brass case, which holds them and the ink too. always stuck at the girdles of their scrivans. Among these are enrolled the muttanies, jougies, or pilgrims, who lead a beastly life, having all things common, and are courted wherever they come; nor do they ever depart, without leaving a stain to their profession: when they ease nature they scrape an hole. as dogs or cats do. to bury their excrements. to prevent breeding of insects. These are covered. the first with a white sheet. [p.\,192] and carry perfuming pots. And bless all as they pass; the others have a snapsack. a mirchal, and a patch'd coat. rambling up and down ads the Fakiers; the first are buried with their heels upwards and heads downwards; the others sometimes buried, sometimes burnt. Juglers, etc. At the heel of these may be reckoned the Bengal juglers, mountebanks, and conjurers, as also the dancing people; these are vagrants. that travel to delude the mobile by their hocus pocus tricks (living promiscuously like our Gypsies); among whom I saw one who swallowed a chain, such as our Jacks have, and made it clink in his stomach; but pulling it out. it was not so pleasant to the spectators (being mostly ladies, for whose diversion he was brought) they puking when it was accompanied with a filthy roapy slaver. \ldots I was promised to see a fellow that cast up his tripes by his mouth, stomach and all, shewing them to the beholders; but he was executed, having some time allowed him to prepare himself for it: \end{quote}},

In fact, economic life is pervaded by culture and depends, Fukuyama maintains, on moral bonds of social trust. This is the unspoken, unwritten bond between fellow citizens that facilitates transactions, empowers individual creativity, and justifies collective action. In the global struggle for economic predominance that is now upon us - a struggle in which cultural differences will become the chief determinant of national success - the social capital represented by trust will be as important as physical capital. But trust varies greatly from one society to another, and a map of how social capital is distributed around the world yields many surprises.},

METHODS: Forty-three seropositive RA patients by American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria with disease duration of less than 7 years were assigned to the following treatment groups: MTX plus Ayurvedic placebo (n = 14), Ayurveda plus MTX placebo (n = 12), or Ayurveda plus MTX (n = 17). Outcomes included the Disease Activity Score (DAS28-CRP), ACR20/50/70, and Health Assessment Questionnaire--Disability Index. All measures were obtained every 12 weeks for 36 weeks. Analyses included descriptive statistics, analysis of variance, χ², or Student t test. The unique features of this study included the development of placebos for each Ayurvedic pharmacological dosage form and individualization of Ayurvedic therapy. RESULTS: All groups were comparable at baseline in demographics and disease characteristics. There were no statistically significant differences among the 3 groups on the efficacy measures. ACR20 results were MTX 86%, Ayurveda 100%, and combination 82%, and DAS28-CRP response were MTX -2.4, Ayurveda -1.7, and combination -2.4. Differences in adverse events among groups were also not statistically significant, although the MTX groups experienced more adverse event (MTX 174, Ayurveda 112, combination 176). No deaths occurred. CONCLUSIONS: In this first-ever, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study comparing Ayurveda, MTX, and their combination, all 3 treatments were approximately equivalent in efficacy, within the limits of a pilot study. Adverse events were numerically fewer in the Ayurveda-only group. This study demonstrates that double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies are possible when testing individualized classic Ayurvedic versus allopathic treatment in ways acceptable to western standards and to Ayurvedic physicians. It also justifies the need for larger studies.},

  abstract = {The writing of history, even very ancient history, is always linked to contemporary politics, if only because the territorial limits chosen by the historian or his publisher are too often those of a contemporary State. Titles such as The Paleolithic Age in Belgium or in Turkmenistan should therefore not come as a surprise. The territorial limits chosen by the authors of the most recent histories of Ancient India are largely those defined in The Cambridge History of India, the first volume of which was written before 1914. In other words, they are the boundaries of British India at that time, Burma (which has since gained independence) being excluded. Is it still possible to equate Ancient India with the territories of today's Bangladesh, Pakistan and the Republic of India? Would it not be better to extend those limits to countries such as Cambodia, which in 6 AD was no less Indian than Bengal or Orissa, or should we simply be content with histories of Panjab, Magadha/Bihar, Tamilnad, etc. - in other words of the few Indian countries about which we can say something certain?
The answer lies in part in the data available. There has been an enormous increase in data in the past fifty years, and our understanding of that data has also changed dramatically. New texts and inscriptions have been discovered, and documents unearthed long ago have been reinterpreted. Archaeological discoveries both within and outside the borders of British India have shed new light on earlier finds and interpretations. The social sciences and political ideas have evolved, and so has our conception of history.
Professor Fussman will address questions such as these in a lecture in which he describes what a history of Ancient India should be, from Harappan times to the arrival of the first Muslim armies.

  abstract         = {Preface: The postulates that follow have been established as basic premises on which the solid edifice of ancient Ayurveda has been based and built. 1. The Mind-Soul-Body complex forms the basic Tripod of Life. 2. The Pancha-maha-bhutas, plus the Soul-Mind-Time-Direction colossus go to form the basic nine Dravyas (material entities). 3. The qualities or Gunas inherent in them are forty-five in number -- but roughly twenty (ten pairs of opposites dualities) of them are of routine practical importance, as has been sumarised by the pragmatic Vagbhatacharya (vide Ashtanga Hridaya, Sutra 1:19). 4. Karma, i.e. the action resulting from these Gunas is specific and facilitates building up of the framework of Ayurvedic methods of prevention and cure of disease. In fact, the Dravya-Guna-Karma complex is responsible fro maintaining ``homeo-stasis", i.e., the internal, ecological, and physiological balance and harmony. 5. The gross body and the subtle mind are liable to disease and ill-health. The Tridoshas (Wata-Pitta-Kapha) are bodily Doshas (vitiators) just as Raja and Tama are the mental ones. Their balanced harmony is essential for somato-psychic health and well-being, while their disharmony spells disease, ill-health, and finally death. These premises are based on the ancient ``physics and chemistry" adumbrated in the famous Nyaya-Vaisheshika Darshanas as well as the cause-effect complex of Kapila's Samkhya Darshana and the micro-neurology of the Yoga Shastras. The triad of biologically active and universally present organic principles, classically called the Tridosha, are the very basic, organized, vital forces, functioning throughout cosmic creation. Such Divine Dynamism is the common denominator, notably for Yoga and Ayurveda, together with the allied arts and sciences of the ancient, omniscient Hindu saints and seers. The Modern "Unified Field Theory", so valid and true at the gross, physical, mundane level, is also subtly so in matters divine and fields spiritual.},

  abstract         = {ABSTRACT — Vedic sphíj- f. « hip, buttocks » (dual sphícau ) has been associated for along time with Common Germanic * spik-u- « bacon » (Modern German Speck ). Recently,this etymological linking has been carried on by J. KATZ (2006 : 157—194). Moreover, hecompares Greek φίκις ~ φίκιον « anus » by assuming a PIE etymon *sp Ì h 1 -i-K-i-, whatsoever might be the explanation of it. Concerning Vedic sphíj- , no doubt is left that thePIE underlying root was *sp Ì eh 1 - « swell » : the present paper will rather aim at throwing anew light on its morphological formation. One may assume an athematic derivative built witha velar stop such as *sp Ì(e) h 1 -k- « bulk, swelling ». Henceforth, another similar family willbe dealt with : PIE *sp Ì erh 2 -g- ~ *sp Ì reh 2 -g- « spring, burst, spatter ». This derivative of thePIE root *sp Ì erh 2 - « flicker, trampler, crush » (cf. Greek σπαίρω « gasp, pant » and Vedic SPH Ṝ - « jerk, tread underfoot » ) must be compared to the PIE collocation *sp Ì´® h 2 - d Ì eh 1 - « make a footstep, run, hurry » (Lithuanian spárdytis « kick, lash out »). The Gothic root-name * spaurds f. « running » (<*sp Ì´ ® d Ì -) is likely to reflect the univerbation of such acollocation, to which Hittite i š part- ~ i š parza- « flee, run away » eventually belongs. In theSanskrit root SP Ṛ DH- « contend » (<*« haste, hurry to victory » ?), some Vedic forms aremet with, whose vocalism is to be considered as anomalous, namely sp ū rdháse (infinitive)and sp ū rdhán (injonctive, 3rd plural). These forms may be explained as long syllabicresonants, that is a sequence of syllabic resonant plus laryngeal. The phonological treatment of Vedic sp ū rdh- (< *sp Ì´® h 2 -d Ì h 1 -V- ) would be of the same pattern as Vedic g ū rdh- « exalt »(< * ﬁ´® H- d Ì h 1 -V- « sing s.o.’s praises »)},

Filling a significant gap in the literature this is the first in-depth exploration of Tibetan medical history in the English language. It reveals the prevalence of descriptions of the development of the human body - from conception to birth - found in all forms of Tibetan religious literature, as well as in medical texts and in art. By analysing stories of embryology, Frances Garrett explores questions of cultural transmission and adaptation: How did Tibetan writers adapt ideas inherited from India and China for their own purposes? What original views did they develop on the body, on gender, on creation, and on life itself?The transformations of embryological narratives over several centuries illuminate key turning points in Tibetan medical history, and its relationship with religious doctrine and practice. Embryology was a site for both religious and medical theorists to contemplate profound questions of being and becoming, where topics such as pharmacology and nosology were left to shape secular medicine. The author argues that, in terms of religion, stories of human development comment on embodiment, gender, socio-political hierarchy, religious ontology, and spiritual progress. Through the lens of embryology, this book examines how these concerns shift as Tibetan history moves through the formative 'renaissance' period of the twelfth through to the seventeenth centuries.},

  abstract         = {Ayurveda is most commonly practiced form of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in India. There are very few studies showing the knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) of allopathic doctors about Ayurvedic drugs and its use. 

Aims: The study was initiated to assess KAP toward Ayurvedic medicine use among allopathic resident doctors. 

Settings and Design: Cross-sectional and prospective study. 

Materials and Methods: After obtaining permission from the Institutional Ethics Committee, allopathic resident doctors from clinical departments were approached personally. They were given pre-formed validated questionnaire to assess KAP toward Ayurvedic medicine use. Statistical Analysis Used: Descriptive statistics. Results: Allopathic residents had little knowledge about basic concepts of Ayurveda, that is, 'panchakarma' and 'tridosha'. Majority residents (99%) had no opportunity to learn basics of Ayurveda, but 67% residents prescribed Ayurvedic medicines to patients. However, many residents (76%) mentioned that cross practice should not be allowed due to lack of knowledge. One resident knew that cross-practice was not allowed by law. The commonly prescribed proprietary Ayurvedic medicines were Liv-52 (39%), Shatavari (13%), Cystone (12%) and common ailments for which these medicines prescribed were liver disorders (34%), arthritis (18%), cough and cold (13%), kidney stones (11%), and piles (10%). Nearly 76% residents felt incorporation of Ayurveda with modern medicine would attract more patients and at the same time most residents (92%) agreed that Ayurvedic medicines need scientific testing before use. Though 50% of the residents agreed for voluntary training in Ayurveda, 80% denied compulsory training. Nearly 63% residents recommended Ayurveda among all CAMs. Most of residents heard of Ayurveda from their colleagues. 

Conclusions: This study reveals that allopathic resident doctors had little knowledge about Ayurveda and Ayurvedic medicine use but engaged in prescription of Ayurvedic medicines. So some interventions should be taken to increase the knowledge and awareness of allopathic resident doctors about Ayurvedic medicine use.},

  abstract         = {Atherosclerosis, which causes approximately half of all deaths of adults over age 60 in industrialized nations, is a pandemic among inappropriately nourished and/or physically hypoactive children, adolescents, and adults world wide. Although nowadays statins are widely prescribed to middle age and elderly adults with high blood lipid levels as pharmacological prevention for the late complications of atherosclerosis, from a critical point of view statins seem not to solve the problem, especially when compared with certain natural ingredients of our nutrition like micronutrients as alternative strategy. Statin ingestion is associated with lowering of serum cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein concentrations; some prospective studies have shown statistical associations with subsequent modest reduction of mortality from cardiovascular disease. However, specific biochemical pathways and pharmacological roles of statins in prevention of atherosclerosis, if any, are unknown. Moreover, there have been no systematic cost-benefit analyses of life-style prophylaxis versus statin prophylaxis versus combined life-style plus statin prophylaxis versus neither life-style nor statin prophylaxis for clinically significant complications of cardiovascular diseases in the elderly. Further, in the trials of effectiveness statins were not compared with management of nutrition, which is the most appropriate alternative intervention. Such studies seem to be important, as the ever increasing world population, especially in developing countries, now demand expensive statins, which may be unaffordable for mitigating the pandemic. Studies of this kind are necessary to identify more precisely those patients for whom cardiovascular benefits will outweigh the risks and costs of the statin treatment in comparison with nutritional interventions. Against the background of the current pathogenetic concept of atherogenesis some of its possible risk factors, particularly the roles of cholesterol and homocysteine, and the effects of statins versus nutritional (micronutrients) interventions in prevention and treatment of the disease are discussed. The prevailing opinion that serum cholesterol as a mediator of the disease is increased by eating saturated fats and decreased by eating polyunsaturated fats is being challenged. Evidently, the beneficial effects of statins in atherosclerosis are not mainly due to its cholesterol lowering effect, rather than to its "pleiotropic effects". Other pathogenetic factors in atherosclerosis are involved, like inflammatory and immunologic processes, that can be modulated by statins as well as by other drugs or by the Mediterranean-style nutrition and by micronutrients (folate, B-vitamins).},

  abstract  = {Bengal, covering the Ganga delta and the trans-Meghna zones up to the south-easternmost parts of Bangladesh, (for details see the chapter on Historical Geography) was ideally suited to linkages with Southeast Asia from remote times. The extensive Bengal coast, from Suhma to Harikela sub-regions, covered the entire delta-the largest delta in the world. The fluvial network paves the way for riverine communications between the coast and the interior. There is little doubt that the Bengal/Ganga delta provides the landlocked Ganga plains with the crucial outlet to the Bay of Bengal. The Bay of Bengal network is inextricably interlocked with the mainland and maritime Southeast Asia. On the other hand, the close proximity of Harikela with Arakan offers the overland corridor to mainland Southeast Asia. In no other zones of the subcontinent this combination of the overland and maritime networks with Southeast Asia is offered by geography. This unique natural endowment made Bengal one of the most significant areas for sustained interactions with Southeast Asia (see the section on trade in the chapter on Economic Life). There is a growing body of literature on the history of the cultural interactions between these two areas with a particular thrust on the role of Buddhism as the pivotal feature of this network. Bengal, along with Bihar, is noted for the flourishing condition of Buddhism and this area marked one of the last bastions of Buddhism from the 10th century CE onwards, when in the greater parts of the subcontinent Buddhism had started to fade out gradually. The 600-1300 CE phase will particularly figure in our present discussion. As during this period outstanding Buddhist monasteries emerged and flourished at Nalanda, Vikramaxila, Somapura and Mainamati, it is only natural that Bengal's Buddhist network with Southeast Asia is often studied from the point of these premier Buddhist centres in Bihar, northern and southeastern Bengal (Magadha, Abga, Pundra and Samatata regions). Recent decades have also brought to light the importance of the trans-Meghna tracts (Samatata and Harikela) in this Buddhist network. This historiographical shift will be addressed in our present effort.},

  abstract         = {The Mandya district of Karnataka, India, houses a unique Jain settlement constructed about 1000 years ago. Recent excavations by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) indicate a high degree of engineering skills among the builders of this settlement. Adapting to heat-stresses in a region where the Monsoons often failed was and is still a matter of concern. Ingenious methods were adopted to modulate bioclimatic responses to maintain thermal comfort indices. The Aretippurians used composite building fabrics which modulated heat transfer to the interiors. Indeed, the thermal transmittances for these composite fabrics were low to moderate for both the temple complexes as well as the dormitories; these were 0.27 Wm−1K−1 and 0.23 Wm−1K−1, respectively. A site visit revealed that a unique and engineered micro-climate was also made to prevail on this hilltop settlement housing several hundred Jain settlers. A granite skirted reservoir was indeed the pièce-de-résistance promoting hydraulic air-conditioning for eight months of the year around the premises with copious winds blowing over a large and exposed rain-fed reservoir. This fanned chilled air across the open plan temples, courtyards, and lived-in areas. This paper explores bioclimatic responses for around 120 residents to the prevailing indoor settings modulated by an engineered microclimate. This was possible because of the staggered layout, unique building forms, use of mixed building fabric, and carefully chosen glazing ratios which yielded salubrious settings. Clearly, this entailed a complex interplay between the intercepted solar insolation, structure-driven turbulence, and the transfer of heat across the original composite walls within and around the complex, requiring a systematic experimental as well as modelling study. The experimental part of the project involved the calculation of the thermal transmittivity across the walls made up of fired bricks, granite, and limestone, and the theoretical part involved the use of appropriate software to reconstruct air flow and heat distribution across floors, walls, and ceilings to proxy the original flow pattern yielding the comfortable PMV (predicted mean vote) and PET (physiological equivalent temperature) values within these premises. This exercise may well lead to further explorations on indoor comfort adaptations in tropical settings with the use of many edifying vernacular idioms in ancient settlements which prevail even in modern layouts.},

The work appears to be designed somewhat like a manual on Indian polity with special reference to the practices current at the time the work was composed." \\ Connection with Vijayanagara pointed out by Gode on the basis of 3 references to Vijayanagara: 1. Patala 3, v.\,11 \citep[8]{vasu-samr}: \emph{kṣīrasāgaramadhyasthe śvetadvīpe 'tivistṛte\\ vijayākhyapure ramye cintāmaṇigṛhāgrataḥ//11//} 2.

The contributors to the chief part of this volume take up both postcoloniality and translation theory, history, and practice in languages and cultures outside the chief Eurocentric orbit. Yet, it would be risky to assert that whatever their personal formation, they write independent of the Western traditions. Rather, most essayists move out from the Western tradition and use this conglomeration of received notions as a point of departure. Does this congruity of points of departure indicate the congruity of conceptualizing translation theory and practice? A congruity in viewing the history of translation? Or does it indicate that postcoloniality is still operating from Western epistemology? Or that epistemology is neither language nor culture-specific?

There may indeed be a uni-directionality in learning and doing, and hence in translating. We are reminded of Robert Frost’s premise in “Neither Out Far Nor in Deep”: “The land may vary more;/ But wherever the truth may be—/ The water comes ashore, / And the people look at the sea.”

  comment          = {Documents written by men who lived, worked and traveled to Asia between 500 and 1500 CE portray thriving trading centers from Arabia to China. Gordon (Center for South Asian Studies/Univ. of Michigan) synthesizes elaborate detail from these eight memoirs to convey their historical pertinence to the lay reader. Each of the travelers came into contact with diverse people and made startling cultural discoveries. The Chinese Buddhist monk Xuanzang roamed from the Yellow River to Tashkent and eventually into India, writing about his marvelous adventures during the years 618 - 632 as he connected with religious groups practicing Taoism and Zoroastrianism. Ibn Fadlan was sent from Baghdad to the Bulgar kingdom near the Volga River in 921; his text enables the author to explain the early dissemination of Islam. Through the autobiography of Neoplatonic philosopher Ibn Sina, we glimpse the intellectual network teeming in Baghdad during the period 1020 - 1036, when the Abbasid dynasty fostered a range of inventions (the zero, algorithm, astrolabe), translations from Greek and Latin, philosophical inquiry and the use of paper. The travels of Jewish spice trader Abraham bin Yiju between Mangalore, India and Cairo from 1120 to 1160 reveal the period's trust-based business model and the extensive range of trade routes. Imperial Muslim diplomat Ibn Battuta's 14th-century memoir demonstrates that rich questing travelers were the vital mechanism keeping cities like Delhi, Damascus and Mecca in touch. Chinese Muslim Ma Huan's account of expeditions he joined in 1413 and 1421 provides a rare portrait of the Ming imperial fleets. Babur, head of a Mongol army of the steppe, records the movement of marauding horse-driven tribes from 1494 to 1526. Portuguese apothecary Tome Pires headed the first diplomatic mission to China in 1517, precipitating the clash between white and Asian civilization. All of the narratives reveal the highly connected interplay of commodities and ideas that enriched Asia.Pared-down, brief vignettes provide an intimate complement to David Levering Lewis's God's Crucible: Islam and the Making of Europe, 570 - 1215 (2008).

  summary          = {While European intellectual, cultural, and commercial life stagnated during the early medieval period, Asia flourished as the wellspring of science, philosophy, and religion. Linked together by a web of religious, commercial, and intellectual connections, the different regions of Asia's vast civilization, from Arabia to China, hummed with commerce, international diplomacy and the brisk exchange of ideas. Stewart Gordon has fashioned a fascinating and unique look at Asia from 700 to 1500 AD, a time when Asia was the world, by describing the personal journeys of Asia's many travellers - the merchants who traded spices along the Silk Road, the apothecaries who exchanged medicine and knowledge from China to the Middle East, and the philosophers and holy men who crossed continents to explore and exchange ideas, books, science and culture. Arranged chronologically, each chapter focuses on an actual memoir from a traveller of the time - Chinese, Arab, Jewish, Mongol and Portuguese - entrepreneurs who interacted with and moved through this world. Their dramatic first hand observations are woven into a sophisticated new narrative of the period and region.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the connections between Prakrit and early Maṇipravāḷam literature from premodern Kerala. Maṇipravāḷam (literally, ‘gems and corals’) is the emic term for a dominant part of Kerala’s premodern vernacular literature, binding together Kerala’s local language and Sanskrit. As a highly Sanskritised register of a Dravidian language, Maṇipravāḷam has generally been viewed as having been inspired and influenced by either Sanskrit or Tamil literature, grammar, and poetics. This paper, however, highlights a rarely discussed aspect: the role of Prakrit in shaping both Maṇipravāḷam literature and theory. I discuss the relation between Prakrit and Maṇipravāḷam in two connected ways: first, by considering the similarities between the practices themselves, especially in terms of their themes and aesthetics; and second, by examining the implicit ways in which Maṇipravāḷam theory, as it is presented in the Līlātilakam, Kerala’s first grammar and work on poetics, is structured on Prakrit materials or on Sanskrit materials dealing with Prakrit.},

It is a concise summary of the findings of what attempted to be the first true census of India. There were, as the memorandum indicates, a number of problems encountered: in particular that it was not conducted simultaneously over the whole of India was probably the greatest shortcoming in the undertaking. However, it was a milestone in the development of the census of India and in many senses was the first real census of India. The memorandum also contains much which is indicative of the importance of the census in the creation of categories which became firmly embedded in the consciousness of later census makers, and in the colonial conceptulisation of India. It contains not only substantial amounts of numerical data on the matters enumerated but also delightful anecdotal details concerning India at the time.},

  abstract  = {In her lecture, Phyllis Granoff examines medieval stories from India’s traditional religions – Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism – that describe encounters between different faiths. Stories of conflict prevail, but there are also stories that create a space for shared religious practice.

Behind the many strategies for dealing with other religions is a clear awareness that religious pluralism is a challenge at all levels of society. By openly acknowledging the need to come to terms with others who espouse different beliefs, these medieval Indian stories, Professor Granoff  argues, are surprisingly relevant today.

Phyllis Granoff is a Lex Hixon Professor of World Religions at Yale University (New Haven, USA).},

Despite these hallmarks of social complexity, the Indus lacks clear evidence for elaborate tombs, individual-aggrandizing monuments, large temples, and palaces. Its first excavators suggested that the Indus civilization was far more egalitarian than other early complex societies, and after nearly a century of investigation, clear evidence for a ruling class of managerial elites has yet to materialize. The conspicuous lack of political and economic inequality noted by Mohenjo-daro’s initial excavators was basically correct. This is not because the Indus civilization was not a complex society, rather, it is because there are common assumptions about distributions of wealth, hierarchies of power, specialization, and urbanism in the past that are simply incorrect. The Indus civilization reveals that a ruling class is not a prerequisite for social complexity.},

  abstract         = {<p><em>The Trotula</em>was the most influential compendium of women's medicine in medieval Europe. Scholarly debate has long focused on the traditional attribution of the work to the mysterious Trotula, said to have been the first female professor of medicine in eleventh- or twelfth-century Salerno, just south of Naples, then the leading center of medical learning in Europe. Yet as Monica H. Green reveals in her introduction to the first English translation ever based upon a medieval form of the text, the Trotula is not a single treatise but an ensemble of three independent works, each by a different author. To varying degrees, these three works reflect the synthesis of indigenous practices of southern Italians with the new theories, practices, and medicinal substances coming out of the Arabic world.Green here presents a complete English translation of the so-called standardized Trotula ensemble, a composite form of the texts that was produced in the midthirteenth century and circulated widely in learned circles. The work is now accessible to a broad audience of readers interested in medieval history, women's studies, and premodern systems of medical thought and practice.</p>},

  abstract  = {The Black Death, often called the largest pandemic in human history, is conventionally defined as the massive plague outbreak of 1346 to 1353 c.e. that struck the Black Sea and Mediterranean, extended into the Middle East, North Africa, and western Europe, and killed as much as half the total population of those regions. Yet genetic approaches to plague’s history have established that Yersinia pestis, the causative organism of plague, suddenly diverged in Central Asia at some point before the Black Death, splitting into four new branches—a divergence geneticists have called the “Big Bang.” Drawing on a “biological archive” of genetic evidence, I trace the bacterial descendants of the Big Bang proliferation, comparing that data to historical human activities in and around the area of plague’s emergence. The Mongols, whose empire emerged in 1206, unwittingly moved plague through Central Eurasia in the thirteenth, not the fourteenth, century. Grain shipments that the Mongols brought with them to several sieges, including the siege of Baghdad, were the most likely mechanism of transmission. The fourteenth century plague outbreaks represent local spillover events out of the new plague reservoirs seeded by the military campaigns of the thirteenth century.},

  abstract  = {Investigates the professional practices of astrologers in urban India and their popularity among the educated middle and upper classes.

Astrologers play an important role in Indian society, but there are very few studies on their social identity and professional practices. Based on extensive fieldwork carried out in the city of Banaras, Words of Destiny shows how the Brahmanical scholarly tradition of astral sciences (jyotiḥśāstra) described in Sanskrit literature and taught at universities has been adapted and reformulated to meet the needs and questions of educated middle and upper classes in urban India: How to get a career promotion? How to choose the most suitable field of study for children? When is the best moment to move into a new house?

The study of astrology challenges ready-made assumptions about the boundaries between “science” and “superstition,” “rationality” and “magic.” Rather than judging the validity of astrology as a knowledge system, Caterina Guenzi explores astrological counseling as a social practice and how it “works from within” for both astrologers and their clients. She examines the points of view of those who use astrology either as a way of earning their living or as a means through which to solve problems and make decisions, concluding that, because astrology combines mathematical calculations and astronomical observations with ritual practices, it provides educated urban families with an idiom through which modern science and devotional Hinduism can be subsumed.

Caterina Guenzi is Associate Professor at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales (EHESS) and member of the Center for South Asian Studies in Paris. Her previous books are available in their French editions.},

  abstract  = {Most studies on nations and nationalism argue that history, or more precisely a 'common past', is crucial for the process of national identity building. However, the existence of one or more concurrent narratives for the construction of this identity is often not accounted for, and there are cases where the ‘common past’ or a ‘collective memory’ is no longer shared.

This book centres on the construction, elaboration and negotiation of the narratives that have become official history in India. These narratives influence politics and the representation of the nation. Depending on the chosen definition of the nation, over 160 million Muslim Indians are either included or excluded from the nation, and considered as ‘foreigners from inside’. The author shows that beyond the antagonism of two representations of history, two conceptions of the Indian nation – secular and Hindu nationalist – confronted each other during the history textbook controversy between 1998 and 2004. The diverging elements of the two discourses are underlined, and surprising similarities are uncovered. Yet, in contemporary India this convergence remains overshadowed in political debates as the definition of the political has been shaped by the opposition between these two visions of the nation. This book analyzes and questions the conception of the school textbook as a tool of national construction and more generally highlights the complexity of the link between historiography, nation-state and nation-building.},

  abstract         = {In the first half of the eleventh century, a group of scholars in southwest India did something new. They began composing systematic texts about everyday life in a register of language sometimes called New Kannada. While looking back toward earlier texts composed in Sanskrit – and even translating portions of them – these scholars centered their poetic ability and their personal experiences as opposed to prior authoritative texts. They described themselves as authoring “worldly sciences” that were “useful to the people of the world,” and they provided extensive reflections on the systematics of knowledge. Epistemic, linguistic, and political concerns were significantly renegotiated in this moment as local context was turned into a virtue for the production of technical treatises. This article uses this moment to interrogate recent discussions of useful knowledge and vernacular science. Usefulness can mean different things at different times and vernacular sciences change according to their language. This article argues for a usage of both terms that is more attuned to historical particulars. A history of useful knowledge from a place that now appears under the double effacement of the non-modern and non-West offers an opportunity to think through central concepts of the history of science without relying on economic or utilitarian discourses.

    Résumé

    Cette étude vise à analyser le traitement du nombre grammatical dans la tradition sanskrite paõinéenne et à replacer dans une perspective historique les spéculations qui s'y rattachent. Elle montre en particulier que les grammairiens indiens, tout en se réservant le droit de donner la prééminence à leur approche linguistique, ne se sont pas désintéressés des problèmes de logique liés à la catégorie du nombre. Afin de mieux appréhender le cadre dans lequel s'inscrit cette réflexion, la première partie de ce travail est consacrée à la théorie du nombre dans le Nyaya et le Vaiseùika ; elle comprend des traductions annotées des Vaiseùikasutra relatifs à cette catégorie (début de n. è. ?), du chapitre sur le nombre du Padarthadharmasai͏̈graha (VIe s. ?) et d'une section du Nyayabhuùaõa (Xe s. ?). La seconde partie, dévolue au nombre dans la grammaire paõinéenne, prend appui à titre principal sur le Vakyapadiya (VP) de Bhartçhari (Ve s. ?), et notamment sur le chapitre sur le nombre (VP 3. 11). . .},

  abstract     = {Since most of the metalanguage used for Sanskrit grammar was already established by the second century BCE (Patañjali’s Mah bh ya), innovations represent a marginal phenomenon in the P inian tradition. Analysis of compounds, however, and particularly the question of number in complex forms, induces the grammarianphilosopher Bhart hari (5th c.) to formulate a new concept: the •number-‘ one’-withoutdifference” (abhedaikatvasa khy). Indian grammarians regard a compound as an alternative to an analytical phrase, either form being possible. They observe, however, that the number of the subordinate element expressed by the nominal caseending in the analytical phrase does not appear in the corresponding compound (thus, in the compound r ja-puru a, •king’s servant”, the subordinate element r jan -, •king”, could have a singular, a dual or a plural ending). In order to explain how a number qualifying the subordinate element can still be recognized in the absence of a case-ending •even if one does not determine any particular number —, Bhart -hari introduces the notion of abhedaikatvasa khy in the V kyapad ya. This article proposes to reconstruct the history of this concept through the principal treatises of P inian grammar, from Patañjali to N ge a.},

  abstract  = {The undertaking of a new task in India is often held to require a number of rituals, rules, or customs. The field of scholarly activities is no exception in this respect. Alphabetlearning (vidyārambha or akṣarasvīkāra), to start with, is expected to take place on certain auspicious days, following the scriptures' prescriptions. This is also the case with the inception of Vedic recitation, the age of the upanayana ceremony depending on one's caste. Similarly, Sanskrit classical works are often preceded by an auspicious verse (maṃgalaśloka) paying homage, among other things, to a deity and/or to the author's teacher. Such a maṭgalaśloka is believed to ensure that the composition of the work will be completed without hindrance. Since the ritualization of all important events is deeply rooted in the cultural background, it is not surprising that Indian scribes should, in their turn, insert an auspicious note in their manuscripts before the Sanskrit text they are about to copy. The preliminary invocations of the scribes in the manuscripts of the Kāśikāvṛtti available to us will be dealt with in the first part of this paper. The second part is concerned with the historical transmission of the Kāśikāvṛtti's incipit (its maṭgalaśloka), taking into account new elements of information resulting from the study of the manuscripts used for our edition.

Unlike the maṭgalaśloka, the copyist's invocation is not a part of the transmitted text.},

In the past two decades, intellectual property rights have expanded throughout the globe creating a world in which protections for patents and copyrights have increased and a growing range of knowledge and practices are claimed as property. Driving these changes are U.S. court decisions, the policies of multinational corporations, and the World Trade Organization (WTO). Resistance to this regime has emerged in low-income countries among public health activists concerned about the rising cost of medicines for HIV/AIDS and indigenous peoples who now see their knowledge as vulnerable and pursue ownership claims for their medical and cultural practices},

  abstract             = {Jabir ibn Hayyan, for a long time the reigning alchemical authority both in Islam and the Latin West, has exercised numerous generations of scholars. To be sure, it is not only the vexed question of the historical authorship and dating of the grand corpus Jabirianum which poses a serious scholarly challenge; equally challenging is the task of unraveling all those obscure and tantalizing discourses which it contains. This book, which marks the first full-scale study of Jabir ever to be published in the English language, takes up both challenges. The author begins by critically reexamining the historical foundations of the prevalent view that the Jabirian corpus is the work not of an 8th-century individual, but that of several generations of Shi'i authors belonging to the following century and later. Tentatively concluding that this view is problematic, the author, therefore, infers that its methodological implications are also problematic. Thus, developing its own methodological matrix, the book takes up the second challenge, namely that of a substantive analysis and explication of a Jabirian discourse, the Book of Stones. Here explicating Jabir's notions of substance and qualities, analyzing his ontological theory of language and unraveling the metaphysics of his Science of Balance, the author reconstructs the doctrinal context of the Stones and expounds its central theme. He then presents an authoritative critical edition of a substantial selection of the text of the Stones, based on all available manuscripts. This critical edition has been translated in its entirety and is provided with exhaustive commentaries and textual notes -- another pioneering feature of this book: for this is the first English translation of a Jabirian text to emerge in print after a whole century. An outstanding contribution is that it announces and presents an exciting textual discovery: the author has found in the Stones a hitherto unknown Arabic translation of part of Aristotle's Categories. Given that we have so far known of only one other, and possibly later, classical Arabic translation of the Greek text, Haq's discovery gives this book an historical importance.},

Preliminary analysis shows that the ayurvedic industry, which has a concentrated market structure, is growing at a much higher rate than that of overall manufacturing. Considering the fact that the ayurvedic medicinal ingredients are sourced differently, namely, from herbal, metal and mineral substances that cannot be industrially manufactured, the second question is: what are the challenges faced by the ayurvedic medicine manufacturing sector? The paper also throws light on the economic relevance of ayurvedic knowledge and how modern firms have amassed it in a competitive environment.},

  abstract         = {The present article gives some insight into the current state of research on Nepalese manuscripts. It focuses on some of the oldest manuscripts preserved in or hailed from Nepal, dealing with chronological, palaeographical, and philological issues. The aim is to illustrate that each of these issues is interesting in its own light, but at the same time it should be approached with the help of other disciplines (e.g., epigraphy, calendar history, history, etc.). The first part is devoted to the examination of the oldest Nepalese manuscripts whose date can be determined with different degrees of certitude (among others, a manuscript of the Suśrutasaṃhitā dated 13th April, 878, and a manuscript of the Skandapurāna, dated 10th March, 811). A discussion of the significance of dated manuscripts for the solution of philological problems is also provided.},

For example, French ships taking European goods to Asia returned with cowry shells and Indian textiles valued by West Africans. On the African coast, traders exchanged these Asian products for slaves who, in turn, were sent to France's New World colonies. The circle was completed when sugar and other goods from the Americas were loaded on board and shipped back to France. The Asian-European trading relationship, as a fundamental step in the African slave trade, thus played a crucial role in the development of an integrated global economy in the early modern era. - YaleGlobal},

Focusing on research published over the past decade, the discussion covers the following subjects: early scriptural literature (the Śaiva tantras or āgamas), exegetical and philosophical traditions, ritual and yoga, the roots of Tantric Śaivism, intersections between tantra, inline image and the medieval temple, and debates concerning the relationship between Śaivism and Tantric Buddhism. The essay concludes with a discussion of recent progress in reconstructing the historical contexts of early medieval Śaivism, with a call for further inquiry into its social history.},

  annotation       = {p.188--9: \begin{quote} The above [chronological] table will show that the Purāṇas began to incorporate Smṛti matter from about 200 A.D., and that there were two main stages in the development of the Purāṇic Smṛti materials. In the first stage, which covered a period ranging approximately from the beginning of the third to the end of the fifth century A.D., the Purāṇas dealt only with those topics on Hindu Rites and customs which formed the subject-matter of the early Smṛti Saṃhitās such as those of Manu and Yājñavalkya.\footnote{These topics are: Varṇāśramadharma, Ācāra, Āhnika, Bhakṣyābhakṣya, Vivāha, Aśauca, Śrāddha, Dravya-śuddhi, Pātaka, Prāyaścitta, Naraka, Karmavipāka and Yuga-dharma.} But in the second stage, which began from about the beginning of the sixth century A.D., [p.189] we are astonished to find a well marked improvement on the varieties of the Smṛti-topics. In this stage the new topics added relate mainly to various kinds of gifts, initiation, sacrifices to the planets and their pacification, Homa, consecration (pratiṣṭhā) of images etc., Saṃdhyā, glorification of Brāhmans and their worship, glorification of holy places, Tithis, Utsarga, Vrata and Pūjā. These topics are found neither in the works of Manu and Yāj.\footnote{The Yājñavalkya-smṛti contains verses on Vināyaka-pūjā and Graha-śānti.} nor in the Purāṇas, or portions thereof, which were written earlier than about the beginning of the sixth century A.D. \end{quote} So there is evidence of a growth in interest in donations from about 500 AD. This goes together with the idea argued more recently on inscriptional grounds that there was a major shift at about 1000 from the support of brahmans (to perform vedic rituals) to the giving of gifts to temples.

  abstract         = {‘Early texts’ comprise RHT, RĀrṇ, RAdhy, and RRĀ. The fact that the RSK is also contained in this group is the only important deviation from the traditional scheme of Indian alchemy. This is probably a misplacement since the RSK shows a combination of alchemical and ayur- vedic theories, which is typical for the middle and late periods of Indian alchemy (see, e.g. the medical preparations in Chapter 4 of the RSK). As can be seen from Table 1, RSK is only con- nected to RCINT and RMANJ. It is possible that the low number of constraints was responsible for the misplacement of the text. The remaining four texts certainly belong to the early group. It is an almost undisputed fact that RHT and RARN are founding texts of Indian alchemy. RRA is perhaps a compi- lation, but nevertheless contains basic and old material. Finally, the RADHY comes from a seemingly isolated alchemical tradition which contains many archaic or at least extra- ordinary features. Among these special eatures are alchemical apparatus of a quite primitive character, an unusual terminology using many ‘alchemical hapax legomena’ and an irregular arrangement of the alchemical samskā̄ras. (2) The ‘middle layer’ contains the group RCūM, RRS, and RPSudh. RRS, although held in highest esteem in Indian alchemy, is a compi- lation of previous alchemical material in large parts, and cites intensively from RCūM. The RPSudh formulates the same ideas as RCūM and RRS with slightly different words. In addition, RCint belongs to the middle group. This result is consistent with the style and content of this work. (3) In the ‘late group’, we find texts that are of an obvious medical character. Apart from RMañj and RSS, which are alchemical works with an ayurvedic orientation, the ayurvedic texts BhPr and ŚdhSaṃh, which treat alchemy only in a few chapters, belong to this group. The date of ŚdhSaṃh found with the numer- ical method differs from the traditional res- earch opinion. Dates proposed for ŚdhSaṃh range from the eleventh to the sixteenth cen- tury [cmp. (Meulenbeld, 2000, II B, p. 233)]. Meulenbeld and Ray place the work in the fourteenth century (middle layer) for internal reasons (cf. Meulenbeld, 2000, II A, p. 206–07; Ray, 1956, p. 160–61). The alchemical proce- dures described in the ŚdhSaṃh closely resem- ble those in the BhPr, which is a late text [Sixteenth century; cf. (Meulenbeld, 2000, IIA, p. 245)] and cites from the ŚdhSaṃh. The alchemical teachings of both texts can be compared with those of other late treatises such as the RMañj, where alchemy is partly superseded by ayurvedic theories. In my opi- nion, the ŚdhSaṃh should, therefore, be placed within the late group or at least between the middle and the late groups.},

The selection of the 4,000 sentences contained in this treebank reflects the development of metrical and prose texts over a period of 600 years. We discuss how these sentences are annotated in the Universal Dependencies scheme and which syntactic constructions required special attention. In addition, we describe a syntactic labeler based on neural networks that supports the initial annotation of the treebank, and whose evaluation can be helpful for setting up a full syntactic parser of Vedic Sanskrit.},

In fact, most of them knew little more than a few Sanskrit verses or sholoks which they recited as guides to the selection of particular remedies when they thought they were dealing with the disease to which these texts referred. State Baids are till subsidized in many villages. 2. Jain priests or jaties, and other priests. These depend chiefly upon the Amrit Sagar, an abridgement of Susruta, Charaka and other well-known Sanskrit authors which was drawn up in 1779--1803 by order of Maharaja Partap Singh, one of the Chiefs of Jeypore. \citep[IIa.341--2]{meul-hist} 3. Hakims or Mohamedan physicians, who practised the Yunāni or Greek (more correctly Arabian or humoral) system of medicine. Very few of them were educated. One or two of these are still attached to each of the State regiments. 4. Jarrahs or barber-surgeons, a very poor and ignorant set of men, who bled, drew teeth, applied the actual cautery, and bandaged limbs in cases of fracture. They have great influence still, especially with the women. 5. Sathyas or couchers, who practised reclination of the crystalline lens in case of cataract. 6. Bairagis or Hindu, and fakirs or Musulman, devotees; wise women; clever persons who drive out diseases by the aid of the jharu or broom and charms. 7. Pansaries or Druggists, at whose shops Baids are accustomed to sit and practice. There are no regulations for the sale of poisons, hence there are great risks of accidents occurring. Something ought to be done in this matter. Besides all these the people resorted to temples, make pilgrimages and listened to any one (especially to the priests) who had a word to say on the subject of their diseases, and adopted the advice of any plausible individual. At the present moment it is the fashion for Hindu mothers to take their children to an old fakir who has set up a hut tow or three miles from the town. Some time ago a sweeper used to sit outside the jail gates and pretend to drive out diseases with his broom. Hindus mix up religion so much with every action, particularly where eating and drinking are concerned, that they fear to use strange, and especially European, drugs, which {5}, they think, contaminate them. Of course the greatest care is taken in our hospitals to meet this difficulty, but no doubt it is a cause for the fewer attendance of people of this class than of Mohamedans.},

  abstract         = {The discovery of the “environment” by Jakob von Uexküll (1864–1944) was a decisive contribution to the foundation of today’s view of nature as a whole and as a natural ecosystem, as well as of its inner relationships. With the construct “environment,” the discoverer described not only a spatial concept, but also the subjective world experience of every animal organism. This idea proved to be extremely fruitful for biology, albeit in a rather reduced modification. Biologists who continued to have profound humanistic-philosophical knowledge until the 20s and the 30s of the 20th century, no longer accepted Uexküll’s model due to its metaphysical substructure. Primarily because biologists left behind the philosophical and ideological ideas about the phenomenon “life,” biology became a materialistic and explanatory discipline. Uexküll’s idea did not impede a mechanistic-materialistic conception of biology. Even professional philosophers did not refer to him, only the trained biologist Helmuth Plessner could perhaps serve as a notable counterexample. Some, such as Hans Blumenberg, did not understand Uexküll and expressed themselves disparagingly, some, such as Edmund Husserl, reinvented and modified the wheel. Uexküll’s concept of the environment was most dramatically reinterpreted by life scientists who reduced his complex theoretical explanations to measurable parameters, hereby establishing the singular term “environment” as a synonym for “nature.” Since then, it has been used unreflectively, without taking its homonymy into account. Today, it mostly means “environment” or “milieu.” In opposition to Uexküll’s intentions, it is no longer defined as individual experience and perception of the world by a sensually gifted organism. Uexküll had previously followed Aristotle’s notion of aistheton (the perceptible), which implied that everything perceptible could be explained by principles of perception, to which a perceptual content (aisthema) was assigned.},

TRANSLATION 0F SOME INDIAN BOOKS. I. KALPASTANUM IN order to enable the European reader to form some judgment of the merits of the native Indian physicians, I have ventured upon this translation, which, though not a sastrum, is a book of great note, and is in fact a compilation of every thing that the sasters have written on the subject. It is common in India to hear the native physicians represented by some Europeans as a set of ignorant cheats, and extolled by others as miracles of knowledge and wisdom. The fact however is, that the great body of medical men in India consists of illiterate pretenders to knowledge, few being entitled to be considered as possessed of real knowledge. Most of them are quacks, possessors and venders of nostrums. The medical works of the Hindoos are neither to be regarded as miraculous productions of wisdom, nor as repositories of nonsense. Their practical principles, as far as I can judge, are very similar to our own; and even their theories may be reconciled with ours, if we make allowance for their ignorance of anatomy, and the imperfection of their physiological speculations. Most Hindoo works of any note have been originally written in Sanscrit, from which they have been translated into the modem dialects, as Tamul, Telinga, etc. But the translators are not always equal to their task, and many errors may have crept into the Telinga translation, from which in all probability the original was free. I attempted at first a literal translation of this work, but after many trials I was obliged to give up the task as beyond my power. My next plan was to make an extract; but this the aphoretical style of my author rendered very difficult. What I here present to the reader is a kind of medium between the two plans. In some places I have adhered to my author very closely, while in others I have abridged, and have [p.126:] omitted many quotations which appeared to me quite useless to an European reader. I conceive it impossible to make a literal translation of any Oriental work into the English language, on account of the complete difference in the genius of writing in the two languages. They are all written in a kind of poetical style, and abound in similes, metaphors, and all kind of figures; and they are of course also replete with allusions to their own customs, propensities, and religious ceremonies, unintelligible to an European. The author of the Kalpast\={a}num intended it, I conceive, as a kind of compendium for beginners, to make them acquainted with the general rules of pharmacy, and the opinions of different learned men on the subject. It is full of quotations, which till I discovered them to be such, puzzled me exceedingly. The author's name is seldom mentioned, and one quotation often differs so little from another in meaning, that I thought the book merely a collection of needless repetitions. I have been at pains to exhibit the meaning of the author correctly, and to give the botanical names of the plants which he mentions as far as I was able to understand them. The unsteadiness of orthography which exists in the Telinga language, and the fashionable absurdity of displaying the learning of the author by abstruse, obsolete, and strange words, contributed "ery much to the difficulty of the translation. \end{quote}},

It is especially indulged in by the Nahungs, faqueers, and the poorer classes, as they are unable to procure more expensive spirits. Those who abstain from opium and poppyheads, also make use of a draught of this hemp liquor; for it is notorious that those who are addicted to opium must daily get their accustomed draught, ortherwise they suffer pain in all their limbs. This, however, does not occur in using the hemp plant, as they can abstain from it without any unpleasant effects; and in my opinion it is the least prejudicial of all the intoxicating beverages generally used. The longing for this drink, especially among the lower classes of the population, induced the late government at Lahore to devote a certain sum for its preparation and distribution. Not far far from the outside of the Delhi Gate, near the road to Umritsir, close by my hospital, there was an establishement called Seid Gunge, where this beverage was delivered gratuitously. As might be expected, the Nahungs flocked there in hordes, and this munificence was greatly abused. I made several trials on myself, my friends, and my domestics, to ascertain its effects; and I found that inibriation commenced about half-an-hour after taking it, and lasted about three hours, upon which a sound sleep ensued. Those who have partaken of it, feel no ill effects on the following day; there is none of that headache, giddiness, or nausea, etc. which generally follows inebriation from wine or spirits. The intoxication is accompanied by a good appetite, and the imbibers become excessively jovial; laughing, joking, and talking, often without control. Even if the stomach is surfeited, no ill effect is experienced; the digestion is not thereby impaired, and no costiveness is to be feared. In the Bengal Dispensatory, p.584, it is stated that the composition of \emph{cannabis indica}, called majoon, is most fascinating in its effects, producing extatic happiness, a persuasion of high rank, a sensation of flying, voracious appetite, and intense aphrodisiac desire. [more accounts from the Dispensatory; notes on curing disorders of the mind caused by continuous use of hemp, by suing blisters placed on the nape, leeches on the temples, and exciting nausea by very small doses of tartar emetic or salt purgatives. Notes on preparation, Majoon, Churrus. [p.155:] The cannabis indica has a similar appearance to our cannabis sativa, but they are very different in their properties, and it is remarkable that the former loses its effective virtue when transmitted to Europe.] i.180: Esdaile and mesmerism i.147: native oculists of Lahore. i.},

Were Byzantine hospitals in general highly medicalised in the sense of having learned physicians on their staffs, and thus of being the prime centres of medical excellence in the Empire? Or has too much weight been given to the limited evidence of one undoubtedly impressive twelfth-century establishment, blinding scholars to the lower levels of care and therapy available in the average hospital? This paper steers a middle course between the 'optimists' and the 'pessimists' in the debate. It adds important new manuscript evidence, while also questioning the terms in which the debate has been conducted. It reviews the distinction usually drawn between physicians and lay attendants, and even between personal and impersonal forms of therapy.},

This argument moves past the notion of ethnicity to examine the growing influence of a handful of major cultures--Western, Eastern Orthodox, Latin American, Islamic, Japanese, Chinese, Hindu, and African--in current struggles across the globe. Samuel P. Huntington, a political scientist at Harvard University and foreign policy aide to President Clinton, argues that policymakers should be mindful of this development when they interfere in other nations' affairs. Based on the author's seminal article in Foreign Affairs, Samuel P. Huntington's The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order is a provocative and prescient analysis of the state of world politics after the fall of communism. In this incisive work, the renowned political scientist explains how "civilizations" have replaced nations and ideologies as the driving force in global politics today and offers a brilliant analysis of the current climate and future possibilities of our world's volatile political culture.},

This volume is designed as an important first step towards that goal. The authors loko closely at three genres of texts that have been crucial to the representations of precolonial India. All three essays challenge not only colonialist scholarship but the attempts by religious nationalists to identify Hinduism as the essence of national identity in India and Buddhism as the essence of nationality in Sri Lanka.\\ Review by Richard H. Davis in Journal of Asian Studies (JSTOR), says, p.1410: ``The volume grows out of an irregular colloquium at the University of Chicago concerned with ``Texts and Knowledge" \ldots Inden lays out an overview of their approach to texts in his introduction, drawing on theorists such as V. N. Volosi{11}, Ernesto Laclau, and R. G. Collingwood,\ldots "},

The head of the family would serve as a priest for Ksatriyas and the well-to-do, or would be a householder in an agrakara, that is, a tract of tax-free land given to Brahmans. An enormous number of land grants to Brahmans are revealed to us by the inscriptions. And it is interesting to note that in some instances, for example in the inscriptions of the kings of Vallabhi, the recipients of the grants bear precisely the same caste names as the Brahmans who still live on this land 1300years later.\footnote[4]{4 Sylvain L{\'e}vi, ``Les donations religieuses des rois de Vallabhī," Biblioth{\`e}que de l'{\'E}cole des Hautes-{\'E}tudes, Sciences religieuses, 7 (1896), 75--100, reprinted in M{\'e}morial Sylvain L{\'e}vi, ed.

Ingalls cites parallels in Manu for the idea of (de)merit transference. He suggests that ``Lakulīśa" (Lakuleśa ``staff-lord"?) may be a version of the Greek ``Heracles", the staff-wielding patron of the Cynics.

The present monograph offers a canonical description of the fundamental categories of ontology and metaphysics, among which the category of ‘particularity’ (viśeṣa) plays a major role in the ‘problem of individuation’ of the ‘nature’ of substance in both Indian as well as Western metaphysics. This commentary should be read primarily in relation to Aristotle’s Categories. It is structured in 3 parts. Chapter 1 contains a general introduction to Indian philosophy and the Vaiśeṣika system. Chapter 2 is a textual-philological discussion on the commentary itself, since its first publication in 1961 by Muni Jambūvijayaji up to the present day. Chapter 3 is a ‘philosophical translation’ that reads Vaiśeṣika in the global context of Comparative Philosophy and aims to render this text accessible and comprehensible to all readers interested in ontology and metaphysics.

A new reference work and a fundamental introduction to anyone interested in Indian and Comparative Philosophy, this volume will be of interest to scholars and students in Classical Studies, Modern Philosophy, and Asian Religions and Philosophies.},

  abstract         = {The present dissertation is a study of the Nabīvaṃśa, “The Prophet’s Lineage,” the first biography of the Prophet Muḥammad to be composed in Bangla, in the first half of the seventeenth century. A literary milestone in the multi-ethnic, multi-cultural history of Islam, it marks a significant contribution to Bangla’s rich literary corpus, and became a canonical work for the late-medieval Islamic Bangla literary tradition. This hitherto little-studied text is used to examine the nature of Islamic expansion on Bengal’s eastern frontier, addressing issues of religious competition, identity formation, and conversion. These were central concerns of the author, Saiyad Sultān (fl. 1615–1646), who was an important Sufi pīr. By situating the Nabīvaṃśa, on the one hand, in the literary traditions of medieval Islam—historiographies, tales of the prophets, biographies and ascension narratives of the Prophet Muḥammad—and in local Bangla epic, purāṇic, and hagiographical traditions, on the other, the dissertation studies the processes of translation by which local cultural figures and Bangla literary forms are used to legitimate and root the Arabian Prophet of Islam in Bengal. In examining the life of a text across the subject-author-text-community continuum over a time-span of nearly four hundred years, the dissertation traces the Nabīvaṃśa’s trajectory from its manuscript circulation in southeast Bengal into the print era, investigating the author’s legacy and the text’s meaning in various publics of memory.},

The paper then studies dispersion of five million Indic manuscripts in India and abroad. The paper reveals some earlier efforts to catalogue them. A literature survey on the topic is included in the paper. The paper gives an account of the National Mission for Manuscripts (NMM) in India, its MRC, MCC, MPC, Kritisampada, Vijnananidhi and its output. The paper then studies Scindia Oriental Research Institute, (SORI), Ujjain, which is one of the Manuscripts Resource Centers in National Mission for Manuscripts. Brief historical account of ancient city Ujjain and establishment of SORI, its collection and collection of very rare manuscripts are given. In the end paper concludes with need of international cooperation and suggests for signing MOUs between countries for cooperation on conservation and digitization of manuscripts and prepare an international database and suggests National Mission for Manuscripts (India) like programs in other countries. The paper also suggests for the declaration of manuscripts as national property, cultural heritage and world heritage.},

In translating the past into modern terms and in usig knowledge perhaps previously unavailable, the historian discovers both what has been forgotten about the past and pieces together things never pieced together before. People and social formations are thus caught up in processes that can only be seen in retrospect, and documents and other traces are ripped out of their original contexts of purpose and function to illustrate, say, a pattern which might not be remotely meaningful to any of their authors."\\ p.15: "For while most historians would agree that a rigorous method is important, there is a problem as to which rigorous method they are talking about. \ldots Thus, would you like to follow Hegel or Marx or Dilthey or Weber or Popper or Hempel or Aron or Collingwood or Dray or Oakeshott or Danto or Gallie or Walsh or Atkinson or Leff or Hexter? Would you care to go along with modern empiricists, feminists, the Annales School, neo-Marxists, new-stylists, econometricians, structuralists or post-structuralists, or even Marwick himself, to name but twenty-five possibilities? And this is a short list!\ldots To talk of method as the road to truth is misleading. There is a range of methods without any agreed criteria for choosing." p.16, the so-called ` heartland' of history: `` \ldots `key concepts' of history: time, evidence, cause and effect, continuity and change, and similarity and difference."\\ p.18 argues that we should ask not `what is history' but `who is history for'. History is always partisan. \\ p.18 ``the past can and will sustain countless narratives"\\ p.21, in the section `On Practice', an account of what constitutes the history professionals of the academy and their practices. 1. "themselves personally" 2. ``Second they take their epistemological presuppositions. These are not always held very consciously but historians will have `in mind' ways of gaining `knowledge'. Here will come into play a range of categories -- economic, social, political, cultural, ideological, etc. -- a range of concepts across/within these categories \ldots and broad assumptions about the constancy, or otherwise, of human beings \ldots ." 3. ``historians have routines and procedures\ldots for close working on material: ways of checking it for its origins, position, authenticity, reliability\ldots .", 4. ways of using and interpreting other historians' work, of organising all these elements in new ways and looking for that longed-for `original thesis'. 5. writing up. pressures of the everyday. 6. the reader, consumption of history. p.25: ``history is always history for somone". \\ p.33: ``[History] is never really a matter of the facts \emph{per se} but the weight, position, combination and significance they carry \emph{vis-{\'a}-vis} each other in the construction of explanations that is at issue. \ldots historians transform the events of the past into patterns of meaning that any literal representation of them as facts could never produce."},

  abstract             = {The dominant theories of human placebo effects rely on a notion that consciously perceptible cues, such as verbal information or distinct stimuli in classical conditioning, provide signals that activate placebo effects. However, growing evidence suggest that behavior can be triggered by stimuli presented outside of conscious awareness. Here, we performed two experiments in which the responses to thermal pain stimuli were assessed. The first experiment assessed whether a conditioning paradigm, using clearly visible cues for high and low pain, could induce placebo and nocebo responses. The second experiment, in a separate group of subjects, assessed whether conditioned placebo and nocebo responses could be triggered in response to nonconscious (masked) exposures to the same cues. A total of 40 healthy volunteers (24 female, mean age 23 y) were investigated in a laboratory setting. Participants rated each pain stimulus on a numeric response scale, ranging from 0 = no pain to 100 = worst imaginable pain. Significant placebo and nocebo effects were found in both experiment 1 (using clearly visible stimuli) and experiment 2 (using nonconscious stimuli), indicating that the mechanisms responsible for placebo and nocebo effects can operate without conscious awareness of the triggering cues. This is a unique experimental verification of the influence of nonconscious conditioned stimuli on placebo/nocebo effects and the results challenge the exclusive role of awareness and conscious cognitions in placebo responses.},

These were two treatises on Hatha Yoga, the \emph{Hathayogapradīpikā}, a classical treatise by Svātmārāma, and the \emph{Gheranda Samhitā}, a later work. The two other works are difficult to identify. Dayananda experienced great difficulty in understanding the mystical physiology with its \emph{nārīs} and \emph{chakras}. His mind, as his later works clearly show, was inclined owards the literal, the pragmatic, the rational; and he always found it difficult to cope with the symbolic and the mythological. But he obviously tried hard. The way in which he finally cut he knot is typcial of his literal and pragmatic rationalism. This happened [in 1856] after the winter at Drona Sagar, when he reached the Ganga near Garhmukteshwar. He pulled a corpse out of the river and set to the gruesome task of cutting it up with a knife. `I then carefully examined the heart and compared it with the descriptions in the books. I did the same with the head and the neck. I came to the firm conclusion that theere was not the slightest similarity between the texts and the corpse. I then tore the books to pieces and threw them into the river with the remains of the corpse.' [Original Hindī version: \emph{Paropakārī} (Ajmer: Paropakāriṇī Sabhā) 17, no.\,5 (March 1975), p.\,12. The autobiography of Dayananda was originally published in English in the \emph{The Theosophist} 1 (Oct. 1879): 9--13, 66--8 (Cec. 1879), 2 (Nov. 1880), 24--6.]},

  abstract         = {Recent research has begun to distinguish two aspects of subjective well-being. Emotional well-being refers to the emotional quality of an individual's everyday experience—the frequency and intensity of experiences of joy, stress, sadness, anger, and affection that make one's life pleasant or unpleasant. Life evaluation refers to the thoughts that people have about their life when they think about it. We raise the question of whether money buys happiness, separately for these two aspects of well-being. We report an analysis of more than 450,000 responses to the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, a daily survey of 1,000 US residents conducted by the Gallup Organization. We find that emotional well-being (measured by questions about emotional experiences yesterday) and life evaluation (measured by Cantril's Self-Anchoring Scale) have different correlates. Income and education are more closely related to life evaluation, but health, care giving, loneliness, and smoking are relatively stronger predictors of daily emotions. When plotted against log income, life evaluation rises steadily. Emotional well-being also rises with log income, but there is no further progress beyond an annual income of ~$75,000. Low income exacerbates the emotional pain associated with such misfortunes as divorce, ill health, and being alone. We conclude that high income buys life satisfaction but not happiness, and that low income is associated both with low life evaluation and low emotional well-being.},

  abstract         = {This review aims to explore the toxicological aspects of mercury-based herbo-metallic preparations like cinnabar and “Rasasindura” that are primarily composed of mercuric sulfide (HgS). Cinnabar-containing preparations have been used extensively in Indian and Chinese systems of medicine for treatment of chronic ailments like syphilis, high fever, pneumonia, insomnia, nervous disorders, deafness, and paralysis of the tongue. Contrary to Western medicine, which does not promote the use of mercury due to its toxic effects, Indian and Chinese traditional practitioners believe that mercury-based formulations have potent therapeutic efficacy, while there is no toxicity due to the unique and repeated purification processes employed during preparation. However, lack of proper pharmacovigilance and widespread self-medication has resulted in undesirable effects to certain sections of the consumers of these preparations, which have contributed to the negative publicity for these forms of medicine. Variations in the quality of the preparations coupled with the lack of understanding of the differences in the recommended dosages and treatment strategies adopted by traditional medicine practitioners, further fuels concerns in the Western world on the safety and efficacy of traditional medicine. But in spite of these concerns, concerted efforts to understand the biological interactions and transformations of these preparations are yet to gain momentum. Although scattered reports on the toxicity of these preparations are available in literature, their mechanism of action has not been conclusively established. Long-term pharmacotherapeutic and in-depth toxicity studies are needed to address the apprehensions raised by these herbo-metallic preparations.

  abstract            = {ABSTRACT In critiquing methodologies of the “global” as a spatial unit of analysis or a receptacle for influence across the planet, this essay positions India so as to assess the role and forms of science in the modern world. By taking the mid-nineteenth century as a moment of departure, it asks why, under what conditions, and to what effects Indians accepted science, but not biomedicine, in the high noon of colonialism. Existing imperial histories of science that are primarily fixated on the eighteenth century cast science as a site of exchange and dialogue, thus replicating the narrative of European expansion overseas. Instead, the power of science is here understood in the context of the politics of religion and rationality. In a synoptic overview, the essay assesses the archaeology of science and the blurred practices between religion and science, described here as “insurgent.” It argues that science in India was a form of enchantment, while religion had become a form of disenchanted but rational knowledge. Unlike in Europe, and contrary to orientalist positions, science in India neither declared the death of God nor became “spiritualized” via religion. Instead, science inflected religion; and religion, in turn, facilitated a rational mediation between science and man. This specific relationship accounts for the “soft landing” of science in India and its usurpation in the service of an unapologetic national modernity.},

  abstract         = {Product Description: This text is a new translation by Prof. John P. Keenan of the second century Samdhinirmocana Sutra, a foundational Yogacara (Consciousness Only) text, which is also the basic sutra of the Fa-hsiang School. (Taisho \#676) [Ch: Chieh-shen-mi-ching] [Jp: Gejinmikkyo] Translator's Introduction The Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning (Samdhinirmocana-sutra) is a foundational text in the development of Yogacara thinking in India. It was apparently composed in the second century C.E. It ranks as the initial source for much basic Yogacara thinking, because it presents the first Yogacara attempt to develop a hermeneutic for interpreting the Prajnaparamita (Perfection of Wisdom) literature. The Prajnaparamita scriptures signaled the arising of Mahayana Buddhism and presented a thoroughgoing critique of the conceptualist approach of the earlier Abhidharma philosophi- cal schools. The writers of the Prajnaparamita works deny the validity of any conceptualist understanding of doctrine, seeing such conceptual understanding as fabrication (prapanca). Their stress was upon the immediacy of wisdom (prajna) in emptiness (sunyata) and its validation in practice (paramita) rather than in analysis. The Yogacara masters inherited this mystical approach of the Prajnaparamita texts. How- ever, they did not reject the validity of theoretical Abhidharma. Rather they attempted to construct a critical understanding of the consciousness that underlies all meaning, both mystical and theoretical. Their focus was on doctrine, but as it flowed from the practice of meditative centering (yoga), rather than as it was understood in acts of conceptual appre hension. In contrast to the Prajnaparamita texts' negation of all theory in favor of empti- ness, the Yogacarins championed the validity of theory in the context of emptiness. It was the need to affirm both the mystical thrust of the Prajnaparamita and the theoretical approach of the Abhidharma that seems to have led to the doctrine of The Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning. Ther are three distinct themes in this scripture. After the in troduction in Chapter One, Chapter Two presents the first theme , a discourse on ultimate meaning (paramartha) in the style of the Prajnaparamita texts. That meaning is not to be analyzed by differentiating oneconcept from another. All words and ideas are nothing but inventions and validate nothing real, for all thingsare empty of any essence (svabhava) that might support their analytical apprehension . Yet it was felt that there was a need for verbal expositions of doctrine. Indeed, the Prajna- paramita text s are themselves such verbal expositions of the meaning of the Buddha' s teachings.The initial Yogacarins had then to evolve a method to affirm both the central, ultimate validity of mystical insight and the conventional validity of verbal explanation. The second theme consists in the development of a critical understanding of the consciousness that expresses itself in both mystical insight and verbal theory . Chapters Three to Five outline this critical understanding. Chapter Three lays the basic foundation in itsdescription of the nature of the container consciousness (alaya-vijnana) and its relationship to thinking and perception. Chapter Four then turns to an explanation of the three characteristic patterns in which consciousness functions. The basic inter-dependent (paratantra) nature of consciousness is explained as evolving toward illusory verbal imagining (parikalpita), but yet capable of being converted (asraya-parivrtti to the full perfection of awakening (parinispanna). This understanding allows one to describe the imagined pattern as empty, while assigning a conventional validity to paratantric under-standing, once it has been converted from clinging to those imaginings. Chapte Five then applies this formulation of the three patterns of consciousness to an understanding of the essential no-essence of all things, i.e., to the Prajfiaparamita notion of emptiness.The constant point is that all clinging to imagined essences is empty of meaning and illusory. In thi s context the passage on the three turnings of the wheel of doctrine is presented. Here the underlying intent (samdhi) not only of Hinayana teaching but also of the Prajna-paramita scripture s is presented as in need of explication, for their meaning has to be drawn out (neyartha) through the fully explicit (nitdrtha) hermeneutic of the previous analysis of consciousness. Chapters Six to Eight present the third theme, the implica- tions of thi s understanding of consciousness for practice. Chapter Six treats centering (yoga), from which the previous insights have been elicited. Its two moments of quietude and vision reflect the central concern with mystical insight, with the conventional expression of ineffable truth. Chapter Seven describes the bodhisattva stages and the six perfections (paramitas). The eighth (and final) chapter concentrates upon the wisdom activity of a Tathagata and includes an explanation of the meaning of scripture (sutra), discipline (vinaya), and theory (matrka), thus ending the scripture with an analysis of theory and reasoning. Throughout, the hermeneutic employed seeks to make explicit (nirmocana) the underlying meaning and intent (samadhi) of the Buddhaas enunciated in previous Mahayana texts.The Scripture on the Explication of Underlying Meaning is then the initial Yogacara presen-tation of a critical understanding of the genesis of meaning within consciousness, and constitutes th e basic hermeneutic for the subsequent thought of Asanga and Vasubandhu. There are two Western-language translations. The firstis French rendering entitled Samdhinirmocana Sutra: U explication des Mysteres by Etienne Lamotte (Paris: Adrien Maisonneuve, 1935). The second is an translation entitled Wisdom of Buddha: The Samdhinirmocana Sutra by John Powers (Berkeley, CA: Dharma Publishing, 1995).[http://gigapedia.com/items/99373/wisdom-of-buddha--the-samdhinirmocana-sutra--tibetan-translation-series-] Both are careful and intelligent translations. Both include the Tibetan text .},

  abstract         = {pp. 136 ff. argue that Hoernle misjudges the osteological remarks in the Brāhmaṇas, especially the Śatapatha Br.  The enumeration of the bones in the Brāhmaṇas, says Keith, is derived from correspondences with the numbering of various verse forms, not from anatomy.

P. 138: "We must rather recognise that we are still dealing with an epoch before the systematic study of medicine and with theologians who were by no means troubled by facts in their identifications. Dr. Hoernle has, we think, laid too much stress on the passages cited from the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa."

Keith also undoes Hoernle's dating of the Yajñavalkya smṛti because he cites books of Y. that are late and attributed to Śāṇḍilya not Y. And therefore, too, since these texts are from the west (Śāṇḍilya) not the east (Yajñavalkya) and they cannot be evidence that they borrowed from Suśruta who was from the east.

p. 139: "There are many other points of great interest in Dr. Hoernles book. Unfortunately the doubtfulness of the chronology renders impossible any useful comparison with Greek Medicine. So far as it goes the evidence tells conclusively against Greek borrowing from India, and the possibility of Indian borrowing from thence cannot be refuted until some satisfactory evidence can be adduced allowing us to assign Caraka and Suśruta to an earlier date than the beginning of the Christian era. Nor can it be denied that the history of Indian Astronomy tells in favour of Indian borrowing from Greece. The Greek princes of Bactria no doubt brought with them physicians trained in the Alexandrian schools in which as early as the first half of the third century B. C. an extensive system of dissection of the human body prevailed (p.IV)."},

So marked a divergence of linguistic usage is frankly incredible if the author of the two texts were identical, and the identification, which rests on no early evidence - for the Maṅgala of the Yogabhāṣya is not explained by Vācaspati Miśra - no longer can stand in the way of the frank acceptance of Professor Jacobi's view that the Yoga Sūtra is the work of a period when the doctrines of Vasubandhu and Vijñānavāda of the Buddhists were well known and powerfully influenced the Yoga school."},

Kemp describes these two opposed historical worlds, these "time texts," and traces the transition between them, its mechanism, and its motivation, concluding by drawing out the epistemological consequences of supersessive history for the modern intellect.},

  abstract         = {The Sangītaratnākara («The Ocean of Music») written by Śārngadeva in the 13th century is the most important theoretical work on Indian
classical music. Its prologue, the Pindotpatti-prakarana («The Section of the Arising of the Human Body»), deals with the Indian science of the
human body, i.e. embryology, anatomy, and the Hathayogic heory of Cakras. The sources of this work are found in the classical medical texts
(Āyurveda) such as Caraka, Suśruta and Vāgbhata, the Hathayogic texts as well as in the encyclopaedic texts (Purāna). After philologically
analyzing the mutual relation and background of these texts, the author demonstrates the reasons why the human body is described in this
musicological work. His investigation reveals the Indian mystic thought of body and sound. This study, although an Indological one, is an attempt
to answer the universal question what music is, i.e. how music is created in the human body, what the effect of music on the human body
is, and what music aims at. The second half of the book consists of a translation of the original text of the Pindotpatti-prakarana, including
commentaries, with plenty of annotations.},

  abstract         = {The present doctoral dissertation collects materials pertinent for the text-historical evaluation of several unpublished commentaries on the Kirātārjunīya, a classical Epic Poem in Sanskrit. Although the collected data deal primarily with a single poem, their analysis presented in the current thesis can be considered exemplary for the study of other texts belonging to the same genre — namely, the Sanskrit epic poetry. In this way, the current dissertation contributes to the broader field of study of classical Indian literature.

The first chapter of my doctoral dissertation is concerned with general methodological issues. I commence my work by laying out the method of structural analysis of the commentaries on mahākāvya and subsequently deal with several questions pertaining to the composition of these texts. The second chapter comprises an examination of several important unpublished commentaries on the Kirātārjunīya. In dealing with each of these texts, I provide a detailed description of its manuscripts first and, in the following step, survey and evaluate all the relevant historical information pertaining to the author and the composition of the respective work. The third chapter briefly examines various procedures adopted by individual commentators, by means of which the texts of their predecessors were integrated into their own works. The analysis of textual reuse described in this chapter can be applied, on the one hand, in order to examine other similar works and, on the other hand, in order to evaluate the manuscript transmission of individual texts, a problem that is dealt with in the subsequent chapters of my dissertation. In the fourth chapter, I describe the available manuscripts of a single commentary on the Kirātārjunīya, the Laghuṭikā by Prakāśavarṣa. In the fifth chapter, I attempt a detailed analysis of the data about the author's life and works available to us so far. In the sixth chapter, I finally turn to a text-historical analysis of the available versions of the Laghuṭikā. In so doing, I pay particular attention to highlighting various difficulties involved in the attempt to compare these versions with each other. In a short conclusion, I, therefore, propose possible strategies, which could aid in solving the problems thus described.},

It suggests that this official poetic projects its proximity to the contempor- ary Turkish invasion (ca. 1205 CE ), and the attendant crisis and restructuring of the Sena state. Some idiosyncratic poems, however, evince a historical dynamic that is both distinct and inseparable from the official poetic: the proud assertion of a San- skrit literary provincialism in the context of a shrinking and threatened state. By correlating a pattern of poetic representation with a discrete period and locality, the present inquiry brings into focus the mutually constitutive relationship between literary interpretation and political historical interpretation for the study of early South Asia. And by tracing what was relatively peculiar and singular to this literary world, it strives to erode established scholarly visions of the endless uniformity of premodern literary-political life.},

It offers a selective overview of individual liberation as dealt with in Indian texts and rituals at different times. Starting from the two prominent approaches to this problem, namely, that of jivanmukti ('liberation in one's lifetime') and that of videhamukti ('liberation beyond the body'), some important questions have to be considered: How has life been thought compatible with moksa? How have 'life' in the concept of the 'liberated living' and 'death' in the concept of the 'disembodied liberated' been conceived by philosophers, poets, religious thinkers, ritual practitioners and social activists? Coming from various disciplinary backgrounds - Indology, Religious Studies, Social Anthropology - the contributors explore these questions in the context of their particular fields of research. Through this multi-faceted approach, the volume presents an original and substantial analysis of an intriguing topic touching on many aspects of religious and secular life. The careful interpretation of the sources by a group of internationally renowned scholars leads to critical perspectives on some crucial developments in the history of Indian religion.},

  abstract         = {Broadly conceived, this article re-imagines the role of conjecture in textual scholarship at a time when computers are increasingly pressed into service as tools of reconstruction and forecasting. Examples of conjecture include the recovery of lost readings in classical texts, and the computational modeling of the evolution of a literary work or the descent of a natural language. Conjectural criticism is thus concerned with issues of transmission, transformation, and prediction. It has ancient parallels in divination and modern parallels in the comparative methods of historical linguistics and evolutionary biology.

The article develops a computational model of textuality, one that better supports conjectural reasoning, as a counterweight to the pictorial model of textuality that now predominates in the field of textual scholarship. "Computation" is here broadly understood to mean the manipulation of discrete units of information, which, in the case of language, entails the grammatical processing of strings rather than the mathematical calculation of numbers to create puns, anagrams, word ladders, and other word games. The article thus proposes that a textual scholar endeavoring to recover a prior version of a text, a diviner attempting to decipher an oracle by signs, and a poet exploiting the combinatorial play of language collectively draw on the same library of semiotic operations, which are amenable to algorithmic expression.

The intended audience for the article includes textual scholars, specialists in the digital humanities and new media, and others interested in the technology of the written word and the emerging field of biohumanities.},

  abstract         = {This book critically assesses the implications of modern medicine's claim to be a natural science. Medicine models its scientific and clinical self-understanding on an obsolete positivist conception of science, reality, and consciousness. In this view, the body is modeled as a biological machine, disease as breakdown of the machine, and therapy as physical measures to fix the machine. The problems besetting medical science and practice are rooted in the inadequacy of the positivist philosophical assumptions regarding the nature of science, reality and consciousness "To base the diagnostic practices and therapeutic regimes purely on knowledge of physical processes in the human body is, in view of this analysis, at best grossly inadequate, at worst thoroughly dehumanizing" (Anton van Niekerk: Editorial Foreword). This means that medicine's clinical method cannot be transformed without transforming the underlying view of science, of reality, and of the human person. The book proposes a broader model of science which overcomes the outdated dichotomy between human and natural sciences. Science is viewed as an interdisciplinary exercise generating multiple perspectives. The insights of the human sciences are essential for scientific clinical medicine. Utilizing evolutionary biology and complexity theory, the author proposes an alternative understanding of reality and human consciousness as a basis for a transformed clinical method. Reality is a hierarchy of systems of increasing complexity. Different levels can be distinguished, namely material systems, living material systems, conscious living material systems and self-conscious living material systems. Each level represents a new manner of being which requires a different scientific discourse of understanding. Using this model of reality the author argues against understanding human consciousness as a byproduct of physical processes in the brain. The human person is a self-conscious, complex, psycho-somatic system, whose well-being is conditioned by much more than physical processes.},

  abstract         = {Krishna Venkateswara Sarma was born in Chenagnnur, Kerala in December 1919. Graduating in Physics and Chemistry, he did his Masters in Sanskrit. He worked for some years in the Manuscripts section of the Kerala University Oriental Research Institute. Later he worked in Madras University’s Sanskrit department, Visveshvarananand Institute of Indological studies, Hoshiarpur, and Adyar library. In 1997, he established the Sree Sarada Education Society and Research centre. He published a survey of Sanskrit manuscripts on sciences found in repositories in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, where he listed over 450 Sanskrit works on Mathematics and Astronomy from Kerala. Sarma’s grandson — Dr. S.A.S. Sarma is continuing the work on surveying manuscript repositories.
Sarma copied out manuscripts in the possession of various families in Kerala. His monumental efforts resulted in a collection of 900 manuscripts, of which about 400 are on astronomy. “Some of his early publications were Grahacaranibandhana of Haridatta, Siddhantadarpana of Nilakantha, Venvaaroha of Madhava, Goladipika and Grahanashtaka of Parameswara. While at Hoshiarpur, he published more than 50 books, mostly on Kerala astronomy, like Parameswara’s Digganita, Golasara of Nilakantha, Tantrasangraha of Nilakantha with the commentaries Yuktidipika and Laghuvivritti of Sankara,” says Dr. M.S. Sriram, retired Professor of Physics, Madras University, and President of K.V. Sarma Research Foundation. Sarma published more than 20 important source works of Kerala mathematicians and astronomers. He brought out 104 books and 450 research papers.

K.V. Sarma Research Foundation was established in 2010, in memory of Sarma’s scholarship, and it houses his manuscripts collection. Prof. Siniruddha Dash, former Head of the department of Sanskrit, Madras University, is the director of the Foundation. Dash has edited two volumes of articles by K.V. Sarma, who had translated Jyesthadeva’s mathematical and astronomical treatise in Malayalam — Ganita Yuktibahsa (1530 CE). Sarma wanted the translation to be supplemented by explanations, diagrams and notations. So, he roped in Dr. M.S. Sriram. Dr. K. Ramasubramanian of IIT Bombay and Dr. M.D. Srinivas. The book, published in 2008, has a foreword by mathematician Dr. C. S. Seshadri and was released at the Chennai Mathematical Institute, and Fields medallist Dr. Mumford was present during the release.
Dr. Mamata, secretary and managing trustee of the Foundation, is working on Laghumanasa, a commentary by Suryadevayajvan on Munjala’s Laghumanasa. Dr. Rama Kalyani is doing an English translation of Buddhivilasini, a commentary on Lilavati. Dash is guiding Prabha Rajagopal, with a Survey of Lexicons on different subjects available in Pali, Prakrit and Sanskrit. All three projects are funded by the TATA Trust. Awaiting publication are some translations and explanatory books — Lagnaprakarana of Madhava, Panchabodha with Sankara Variar’s commentary, Drkkarana, Selected Works of Parameswara, and Selected Works of Puthumana Somayaji. Aditya Kolachana, K.Mahesh, Venkateswara Pai, Veena Bhat and Dinesh Mohan Joshi, have collaborated with Sriram and Ramasubramanian on these texts.

Stressing the importance of preservation of manuscripts, Dash says, “The more manuscripts of a work a scholar refers to, the more authentic is his research. Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute in Pune collected 4,500 manuscripts of the Mahabharata from all over India. Of these, they used 734 to come up with a critical edition. The TV serial ‘Mahabharata’ was based on this edition, and may therefore said to be an authentic version of the Itihasa.”},

  abstract         = {The widespread dissemination of digital surrogates for Islamic manuscripts certainly has the potential to impact scholarship both positively and negatively. Realizing a positive impact is contingent on the accessibility and quality of the digital surrogates and the training extended to the scholars working with them. Indeed, while manuscript digital surrogates have the potential to enhance access for those scholars who might otherwise neglect manuscript evidence, they may also enable neglect of material qualities and with them the essential historical context for the content of a codex. This is particularly concerning for the field of Islamic manuscript studies for which so much codicological and palaeographical groundwork is yet to be conducted and ample training in material manuscript literacy is still lacking. Perhaps surprisingly, our experience with manuscript digital surrogates at the University of Michigan has demonstrated that even “materially distant” digital surrogates can actually enhance understanding of manuscript features, including appreciation for material aspects, and help advance the codicological projects of Islamic manuscript studies. The key is introducing basic material manuscript literacy via exposure to physical artifacts and relying on the surrogates as tools for descriptive training.},

  annotation       = {This book identifies what is meant by sati ("smrti"), usually translated as 'mindfulness', in early Buddhism, and examines its soteriological functions and its central role in the early Buddhist practice and philosophy. Using textual analysis and criticism, it takes new approaches to the subject through a comparative study of Buddhist texts in Pali, Chinese and Sanskrit. It also furnishes new perspectives on the ancient teaching by applying the findings in modern psychology. In contemporary Buddhism, the practice of mindfulness is zealously advocated by the Theravada tradition, which is the only early Buddhist school that still exists today.Through detailed analysis of Theravada's Pali Canon and the four Chinese "Agamas" - which correspond to the four main "Nikayas" in Pali and belong to some early schools that no longer exist - this book shows that mindfulness is not only limited to the role as a method of insight ("vipassana") meditation, as presented by many Theravada advocates, but it also has a key role in serenity ("samatha") meditation. It elucidates how mindfulness functions in the path to liberation from a psychological perspective, that is, how it helps to achieve an optimal cognitive capability and emotional state, and thereby enables one to attain the ultimate religious goal.Furthermore, the author argues that the well-known formula of "ekaayano maggo", which is often interpreted as 'the only way', implies that the four "satipa.t.thaanas" (establishments of mindfulness) constitute a comprehensive path to liberation, and refer to the same as "kaayagataa sati", which has long been understood as 'mindfulness of the body' by the tradition. The analysis shows that kaayagataa sati and the four "satipa.t.thaanas" are two different ways of formulating the teaching on mindfulness according to different schemes of classification of phenomena.},

  abstract     = {The philosophy of psychosis and the psychosis of philosophy: a philosopher draws on his experience of madness.

In this book, philosopher and linguist Wouter Kusters examines the philosophy of psychosis—and the psychosis of philosophy. By analyzing the experience of psychosis in philosophical terms, Kusters not only emancipates the experience of the psychotic from medical classification, he also emancipates the philosopher from the narrowness of textbooks and academia, allowing philosophers to engage in real-life praxis, philosophy in vivo. Philosophy and madness—Kusters's preferred, non-medicalized term—coexist, one mirroring the other.

Kusters draws on his own experience of madness—two episodes of psychosis, twenty years apart—as well as other first-person narratives of psychosis. Speculating about the maddening effect of certain words and thought, he argues, and demonstrates, that the steady flow of philosophical deliberation may sweep one into a full-blown acute psychotic episode. Indeed, a certain kind of philosophizing may result in confusion, paradoxes, unworldly insights, and circular frozenness reminiscent of madness. Psychosis presents itself to the psychotic as an inescapable truth and reality.

Kusters evokes the mad person's philosophical or existential amazement at reality, thinking, time, and space, drawing on classic autobiographical accounts of psychoses by Antonin Artaud, Daniel Schreber, and others, as well as the work of phenomenological psychiatrists and psychologists and such phenomenologists as Edmund Husserl and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. He considers the philosophical mystic and the mystical philosopher, tracing the mad undercurrent in the Husserlian philosophy of time; visits the cloud castles of mystical madness, encountering LSD devotees, philosophers, theologians, and nihilists; and, falling to earth, finds anxiety, emptiness, delusions, and hallucinations. Madness and philosophy proceed and converge toward a single vanishing point.},

  annote           = {While Egypt was in chaos and the Akkadian Empire in Mesopotamia collapsed in the 22nd century B.C.E., the marketplaces of Mohenjo Daro in today's Pakistan were booming. Carts pulled by water buffalo jauntily decorated in henna carried luxury goods along the city's wide, paved streets. Artisans worked lapis lazuli from distant Afghanistan into beads and shaped local steatite into delicately carved seals. Citizens drew water from one of the city's 700 wells or relaxed under the colonnades around a large brick-and-tar lined bath in the center of town.Yet 2 centuries later, the carefully planned metropolis was abandoned, and the number of settlements on its outskirts dwindled from 86 to a mere half-dozen. The cultures of Egypt and Mesopotamia recovered in time, but not so the Indus. Mohenjo Daro and other great cities were never rebuilt, a set of sophisticated symbols was forgotten, and vibrant urban life vanished from the Indian subcontinent until much later.This anomaly is the most puzzling and controversial issue surrounding the Indus civilization, which thrived from 2600 B.C.E. until 1900 B.C.E. (see timeline). Droughts, floods, tectonic shifts, ideological turmoil, and foreign invasions have all been invoked to explain a spectacular collapse that long appeared both sudden and total. But new research suggests that the end may not have been as dramatic or complete as scholars long assumed. Some cities lingered for up to 500 years after others were deserted, and the next wave of urbanism arose far earlier than once thought. Open in new tab"CREDITS: (LEFT) HARAPPA.COM; (BOTTOM AND RIGHT) GIANNI DAGLI ORTI/CORBIS"The rise of Hindu nationalism in today's India has thrust this scholarly debate into the political spotlight. Hindu nationalists' push to see the roots of their religion in the 5000-year-old Indus civilization creates yet another barrier between Indian archaeologists and their mostly Muslim counterparts in Pakistan (see sidebar, p. 1282). “There is no place in the world where the people and culture of the 3rd millennium B.C.E. are more important,” says archaeologist Gregory Possehl of the University of Pennsylvania.Archaeologists have theorized about the end of the Indus for decades. In the 1940s, excavator Mortimer Wheeler suggested that Aryan tribes who swept in from the northwest triggered the downfall. These Aryans were long thought to have brought Vedic culture—considered the root of Hindu tradition—to India at the expense of the Indus people. “Indra stands accused,” Wheeler famously wrote, referring to the chief Aryan deity. But there is no archaeological evidence for an invasion during this period. Many scholars agree that people did migrate into the region from north and east but not until after the decline of the Indus.More recently, some researchers have proposed that climate indirectly affected the Indus. They postulate that the drought-related collapse of Egypt and Mesopotamia and the loss of those markets at the turn of the 2nd millennium B.C.E. led to an economic crisis that upended the Indus system a century or two later. Mentions of Meluhha, presumed to refer to the Indus, vanish from Mesopotamian texts about 2000 B.C.E., says Harvard University Assyriologist Piotr Steinkeller.Climate may have hit the Indus directly as well. According to a 2003 paper, cores drilled from the Arabian Sea indicate that during the 22nd century B.C.E., the Indus River and its tributaries discharged significantly less water, a sign of drought. By 2000 B.C.E., people near Harappa in today's Pakistan were trying to cope with a drying climate by planting different crops, according to recent research led by Rita Wright of New York University (Science, 18 May 2007, p. 978). “People were making adjustments; there was a change in their way of life,” Wright says, although she cautions against making sweeping claims because her data are from only one region.Although Wright and others argue that climate and society are deeply intertwined, Possehl scoffs at the idea that drought explains the collapse. “We should stop thinking about the physical world and start looking at the fabric of society,” he suggests. He believes that the end of the Indus was primarily a matter of ideology, like the collapse of the Soviet Union. Possehl and Michael Jansen of RWTH Aachen University in Germany note that the Great Bath at the center of Mohenjo Daro was abandoned a century or two before the city, suggesting change in a society that they say emphasized water-related rituals.In the end, Wright, Possehl, and other scholars acknowledge that they can't be sure what caused the Indus decline. “There are a lot of theories but little evidence,” complains Harvard archaeologist Richard Meadow, who co-directs current excavations at Harappa.

OF ARCHAEOLOGY AND MUSEUMS, GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN"But the collapse was likely as varied as the civilization itself. Mohenjo Daro and the region of Cholistan, between that city and Harappa, declined dramatically after 1900 B.C.E. However, while rural settlements near Harappa contracted from 18 to four at this time, life in the city surprisingly continued for at least another 500 years, says archaeologist Jonathan Kenoyer of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, co-director of the Harappa dig. And to the northeast, in today's India, the number of sites increased rapidly from 218 to 853 after 1900 B.C.E., according to data from surveys gathered by Possehl.In Gujarat in southwestern India, urban life and even trade with the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf appears to have continued well into the 2nd millennium B.C.E., although exactly how long is a matter of dispute. At the site of Pirak in eastern Baluchistan in today's Pakistan, a small town appears to have thrived continuously from 1800 B.C.E. to as late as the arrival of Alexander the Great in India in 325 B.C.E., says Meadow. Later settlements, however, lack the sophisticated urban planning of even smaller sites from the mature Indus phase.The persistence of settlements raises the question of how much of the Indus culture survived the urban decline. For decades, most archaeologists assumed that the Indus's abrupt end and long hiatus in urban life meant that few if any of its traditions survived. But now it appears that the Indus collapse drove people to the east, into the watershed of the Ganges, which spreads as far as the Bay of Bengal. Excavations along the Gangetic plain show that cities began to arise there starting about 1200 B.C.E., just a few centuries after Harappa was deserted and much earlier than once suspected. That means that some continuity between the first and second wave of Indian civilization is conceivable, says Possehl. Open in new tabClimate chronicler.Rita Wright tracks the Indus response to drought around Harappa."CREDIT: SUSAN WRIGHT"There is no doubt that the hallmarks of the Indus disappeared with its cities, including its unique set of specific symbols, sophisticated standardization of weights and bricks, and rectilinear urban planning. Later urban areas along the Ganges are radically different in layout; the new writing system that eventually emerged is unrelated to Indus symbols; and standardization is missing.But archaeologists such as Possehl see deeper connections. “There is continuity,” he says. A handful of Indus seals showing a deity with three faces in a yogic-style posture may link today's Hindu god Shiva and yoga practices with the Indus civilization. And a variety of technologies and traditions, such as tandoori ovens, oxcarts pulled by water buffalo, and cattle marked with henna are a regular part of village life around Mohenjo Daro even today. Traces of all these scenes can be found at Indus archaeological sites and imprinted upon seals.Did the Indus directly seed what eventually grew into the second wave of Indian civilization? That is a hot political as well as scholarly topic. “This plays a significant role in today's India,” says Possehl. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which ruled India from 1998 to 2004, declared the Indus to be the progenitor of Hindu civilization, a controversial claim in a country with a large Muslim population. While in power, BJP pumped additional funding into Indus-related digs, and its influence over archaeological matters remains strong. Last fall, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) was harshly criticized in Parliament for asserting in a report that the underwater ridge connecting India and Sri Lanka was natural rather than the remains of a bridge built by the traditional hero Rama. Under pressure, ASI suspended two senior employees involved in the report. In May, members of India's Supreme Court expressed sympathy for a lower court decision ordering ASI to investigate the formation.Some Indian scholars argue that early Hindu texts can be used as guides, much as the Bible has been used in Near Eastern archaeology. Respected ASI archaeologist R. S. Bisht, who excavated Dholavira and can quote long passages from Hindu scripture, suggests that the Indus people were one and the same as the Aryans whom Wheeler saw as invaders. That theory finds little purchase with foreign scholars. And one Western archaeologist complains that such talk makes for a volatile mix of science and religion that is “needlessly inflammatory to our Pakistani colleagues.”The intense emotion surrounding the debate is exacerbated by the many questions that remain about the Indus's decline. “There is no silver bullet; there were clearly multiple factors,” says Meadow. “And we still don't know what was the trigger.” But, he says, recognizing that complexity is itself a big step forward.},

Due to the tablets' deterioration, scholars often rely on contextual cues to manually fill in missing parts in the text in a subjective and time-consuming process. We identify that this challenge can be formulated as a masked language modelling task, used mostly as a pretraining objective for contextualized language models. Following, we develop several architectures focusing on the Akkadian language, the lingua franca of the time. We find that despite data scarcity (1M tokens) we can achieve state of the art performance on missing tokens prediction (89% hit@5) using a greedy decoding scheme and pretraining on data from other languages and different time periods. Finally, we conduct human evaluations showing the applicability of our models in assisting experts to transcribe texts in extinct languages.},

The stories of the practitioners focused strongly on transforming a body-self that was configured as a result of living a life in Western cultural contexts where philosophies of mind-body dualisms were taken to underpin daily practices. The practitioners described a well-trodden somatic pedagogical pathway towards liberation from domination that they called 'physicalisation'. The paper illustrates physicalisation as cultivation of bodymind unity and de-identification before exploring the three dimensions of the practitioners' embodied spatiotemporal transformations that we have termed: empowerment, mustery and negating domination.},

  abstract         = {Although hypnosis and meditation represent distinct domains of practice, they appear to overlap in phenomenology, cognitive mechanisms, neural substrates, and potential therapeutic merits. Whereas numerous studies have documented the beneficial impact of these approaches, few have harnessed these distinctive phenomena together, either clinically or as a means of illuminating cognitive questions. This paper introduces the theme of the present issue and discusses the potential value of yoking empirical studies of hypnosis and meditation. The marriage of these seemingly disparate yet overlapping practices promises to improve our scientific understanding of each as well as unravel their underlying mechanisms. On the one hand, albeit largely overlooked by researchers studying meditation, the intimate relationship between attention and suggestion holds important implications for both theoretical models and therapeutic applications of contemplative practice. On the other hand, hypnosis and meditation serve as complementary vehicles for elucidating salient topics in cognitive neuroscience, including the neural underpinnings of perception and cognitive control, and the governing of deeply-ingrained processes. Binding these approaches to the science of attention and suggestion paves the road to a more nuanced appreciation of hypnosis and meditation while fostering novel therapeutic prospects and improving our understanding of consciousness and cognition.},

Guthrie, (eds.), (Edinburgh University Press, 1953). 2nd and 3rd edns., (title changed to A treatise on the scurvy), London, 1757, 1772. James Lind: A Treatise of the Scurvy, 1753. . . . Of the Prevention of the Scurvy I shall conclude the precepts relating to the preservation of seamen with showing the best means of obviating many inconveniences which attend long voyages and of removing the several causes productive of this mischief. The following are the experiments. On the 20th {5}, 1747, I took twelve patients in the scurvy on board the Salisbury at sea. Their cases were as similar as I could have them. They all in general had putrid gums, the spots and lassitude, with weakness of their knees. They lay together in one place, being a proper apartment for the sick in the fore-hold; and had one diet in common to all, viz., water gruel sweetened with sugar in the morning; fresh mutton broth often times for dinner; at other times puddings, boiled biscuit with sugar etc.; and for supper barley, raisins, rice and currants, sago and wine, or the like. Two of these were ordered each a quart of cyder a day. Two others took twenty five gutts of elixir vitriol three times a day upon an empty stomach, using a gargle strongly acidulated with it for their mouths. Two others took two spoonfuls of vinegar three times a day upon an empty stomach, having their gruels and their other food well acidulated with it, as also the gargle for the mouth. Two of the worst patients, with the tendons in the ham rigid (a symptom none the rest had) were put under a course of sea water. Of this they drank half a pint every day and sometimes more or less as it operated by way of gentle physic. Two others had each two oranges and one lemon given them every day. These they eat with greediness at different times upon an empty stomach. They continued but six days under this course, having consumed the quantity that could be spared. The two remaining patients took the bigness of a nutmeg three times a day of an electuray recommended by an hospital surgeon made of garlic, mustard seed, rad. raphan., balsam of Peru and gum myrrh, using for common drink narley water well acidulated with tamarinds, by a decoction of wich, with the addition of cremor tartar, they were gently purged three or four times during the course. The consequence was that the most sudden and visible good effects were perceived from the use of the oranges and lemons; one of those who had taken them being at the end of six days fit four duty. The spots were not indeed at that time quite off his body, nor his gums sound; but without any other medicine than a gargarism or elixir of vitriol he became quite healthy before we came into Plymouth, which was on the 16th June. The other was the best recovered of any in his condition, and being now deemed pretty well was appointed nurse to the rest of the sick -- As I shall have occasion elsewhere to take notice of the effects of other medicines in this disease, I shall here only observe that the result of all my experiments was that oranges and lemons were the most effectual remedies for this distemper at sea. I am apt to think oranges preferable to lemons, though it was principally oranges which so speedily and surprisingly recovered Lord Anson's people at the Island of Tinian, of which that noble, brave and experienced commander was so sensible that before he left the island one man was ordered on shore from each mess to lay in a stock of them for their future security. -- Perhaps one history more may suffice to put this out of doubt.

  abstract         = {This volume brings together sixteen articles on the religions, literatures and histories of South and Central Asia in tribute to Patrick Olivelle, one of North America’s leading Sanskritists and historians of early India. An exceptionally prolific scholar, Olivelle’s best-known works include ‘Manu’s Code of Law’ (2005), ‘The Early Upaniṣads’ (1998) and ‘The Āśrama System’ (1993). Over the last four decades, the focus of his scholarship has been on the ascetic and legal traditions of India, but his work as both a researcher and a teacher extends beyond early Indian religion and literature. ‘Religion and Identity and South Asia and Beyond’ is a testament to that influence.

The contributions in this volume, many by former students of Olivelle, are committed to linguistic and historical rigor, combined with sensitivity to how the study of Asia has been changing over the last several decades. Several of the essays examine the construction of religious and cultural identity (whether among Brahmins, Buddhists, Dalits or Muslims), while others are concerned particularly with problems of historical reconstruction and textual interpretation.},

  annote           = {What Patanjali presents us with is an elaborate and fairly late systematic and syncretistic form of yoga. Omitting all the details we can say that there are three main aspects of this system of yoga: 1) the normal activities of mind, cittavrtti, 2) the way to stop these, their nirodha (viz. abhyasa and vairagya), and 3) the result of this struggle (viz. nirodha, samadhi, etc.). This 'model' can, mutatis mutandis, be found in virtually all Indian philosophical texts, even the most popular ones, from the earliest time onwards. It is not a model that I wish to impose upon the Indian texts, but rather one that emerges from a normal philological reading of them when special attention is paid to the terminology used. The purpose of this paper therefore is to draw attention to the fact that some of the most popular Indian texts can actually be read as manuals of yoga, i.e. as popular texts presupposing some kind of systematic yoga consciously dealing with and covering the three aspects mentioned above. Accordingly, a few major texts have been considered to exhibit the central role of yoga in Indian philosophy.},

  abstract         = {Aśoka's reign ushered in an era of major transformations in India's religious life. The 6th to 4th centuries BCE had witnessed, in the plains around the Ganges and Jumna rivers, the emergence of the first urban centers in South Asia since the Indus Valley Civilization. While the precise reasons and mechanisms for this development are not fully understood, it has long been taken for granted that it is not mere coincidence that it was accompanied by equally dramatic changes in the sphere of religion —especially the rise to prominence of ascetical movements. Although the precise origins of such movements are unknown, they appear on the scene in two species: one emerging from within the Brahmanical priestly religion that was already more than half a millennium old, and another comprising self-consciously anti-Brahmanical doctrines traced back to legendary teachers whose authority resided in their personal accomplishments (Gotama the Buddha, the ‘Enlightened’; Mahāvīera the Jina, the ‘Victor’). As this story is generally told, it is the Buddhists and the Jains who are in the limelight, bringing new ideas to an old world, challenging the cant and rigid orthodoxy of the brahmin priesthood, just as the early Christians were said to have exposed the hypocrisy and superficiality of Pharisaic piety. And rather as the new Christian vision was embraced and established in the Roman Empire by Constantine, the emperor Aśoka Maurya proclaimed the Buddha's dharma to be the religion of this new world.},

The name Garga and astral works attributed to this author were known to the Chinese before the sixth century C.E. The decipherment of this partially edited text by an international team of scholars has been ongoing since 2017. An unusual feature of G1 overlooked by previous scholars is that the first Aṅga, titled “Karmaguṇa” (“constituents of ritual acts”) has a different character when compared to the subsequent ones in terms of structure, format, and content. While a detailed analysis is possible only when a complete critical edition of G1 is produced, some of the salient differences may be readily discerned based on our preliminary examination of the text.},

These discoveries may be summarized as follows: The Yavanajātaka was an astrological/astronomical work composed in 269/270 CE. by Sphujidhvaja, an \"Indianized Greek\" who lived in the realm of the Western Kṣatrapas. The work was a versification of a prose original in Greek composed by Yavaneśvara in Alexandria in 149/150 CE. The work, though highly corrupted and clumsily expressed, contains algorithms of \"ultimately Babylonian origin\" and the earliest reference to the decimal place-value with a symbol for zero (bindu). Pingree's discoveries were based largely on readings from the last section of the Yavanajātaka, described by him as \"Chapter 79 - Horāvidhiḥ\", an exposition of mathematical astronomy. In the recent years, scholars including Shukla (1989) and Falk (2001) pointed out some major flaws in some of Pingree's interpretations and reconstitution of the text. However, further progress of a proper reevaluation of the controversial contents of this chapter has so far been hampered by the lack of a better manuscript. In 2011-2012, additional materials including a hitherto unreported copy of the Yavanajātaka became available to the present author. This paper will therefore be the first attempt to reexamine Pingree's key interpretations of the Yavanajātaka, focusing on this last chapter, in the light of the new textual evidences.},

  abstract         = {In its classical formulation as found in Svātmārāma’s Haṭhapradīpikā, haṭhayoga is a Śaiva appropriation of an older extra-Vedic soteriological method. But this appropriation was not accompanied by an imposition of Śaiva philosophy. In general, the texts of haṭhayoga reveal, if not a disdain for, at least an insouciance towards metaphysics. Yoga is a soteriology that works regardless of the yogin’s philosophy. But the various texts that were used to compile the Haṭhapradīpikā (a table identifying these borrowings is given at the end of the article) were not composed in metaphysical vacua. Analysis of their allusions to doctrine shows that the texts from which Svātmārāma borrowed most were products of a Vedantic milieu—bearing testament to Vedānta’s newfound interest in yoga as a complement to jñāna—but that many others were Śaiva non-dual works. Because of the lack of importance given to the niceties of philosophy in haṭhayogic works, these two non-dualities were able to combine happily and thus the Śaiva tenets incorporated within haṭhayoga survived the demise of Śaivism as part of what was to become in the medieval period the dominant soteriological method in scholarly religious discourse in India.},

Then, giving it a twist so that the live flesh might meet the other live surface, by healing applications they fashioned for them other imperfect noses. There is left above, between the eyebrows, a small hole, caused by the twist given to the skin to bring the two live surfaces together. In a short time the wounds heal up, some obstacle being placed beneath to allow of respiration. I saw many persons with such noses, and they were not so disfigured as they would have been without any nose at all, but they bore between their eyebrows the mark of the incision. \end{quote*} Cf.\ also I.215--6 on nose-chopping by Shahjahan's soldiers in Kashmir (ca.1635, with no reconstruction mentioned)\\ -- Letter of Mike Miles, 4 March 1999.},

This Indian Mirror for Princes does indeed contain some notable resemblances to the \emph{Sirr}, and the question of its possible influence upon it is discussed below." \\ p.203: ``The \emph{Sirr} is not connectred with the shorter alchemical texts atttibuted to Aristotle, nor with the other alchemical texts that bear the same title of \emph{Sirr al-asrār} or \emph{Secretum} (var.lec. \emph{Secreta}) \emph{secretorum} (see, e.g., Ferguson's \emph{Bibliotheca chemica [74]}). The best-known of these homonymous works is by al-Rāzī [203], and has been edited and translated both by Ruska and by Karimov (see below, p.243)." \\ p.210: ``The passages which refer to Indians and Turks offer no certain indications of late compostition, but, on the contrary, are paralleled by similar passages in earlier literature.

Indian culture was known to the Seleucids, in whose days Megasthenes' work on India was written. The description of the `custom of the Indians' in \emph{Sirr} II has an analogue in this work. J. W. M'Crindle, \emph{Ancient India as described by Megasthenes and Arrian} [173], quotes a passage from the book, as known to Strabo (XV.i. 53 ff.), describing the Indian king's hunting: \begin{quote}`Crowds of women surround him, and outside of this circle spearmen are ranged. The road is marked off with ropes, and it is death, for man and woman alike, to pass within the ropes'.\end{quote} For knowledge of Indian in Hellenistic times, we have Philostratus' \emph{Life of Appolonius of Tyana} [192] -- mainly Books II and III (there is further information in Jarl Charpentier, \emph{The Indian Travels of Appolonius of Tyana} and in O'Leary [188], p.126.

Although the earliest textual references are found in the Vedic literature (1500-1000 B.C.), it was not until the second century A.D. that the planets were represented in anthropomorphic form. The personification of the planets was engendered by the introduction of Hellenistic astrological theories and imagery into India through the trade contact between Rome and the dynastic realm of the Western Ksatrapas. As a corollary to the scientific and cultural beliefs, the Western calendrical system of the seven-day week was also introduced in the early fourth century and gradually gained currency. This interdisciplinary investigation of textual, art-historical, and epigraphical evidence concludes that the origin of the Indian representations of the planetary deities was directly dependent upon the adoption of the seven-day week. The temporal order of the planetary deities according to their regency over the days of the week was subsequently observed in all astrological and religious texts. The earliest surviving group representations of the planetary deities, which are from Madhya Pradesh and date to ca. A.D. 500, also followed the temporal order, as do all later portrayals. Inscriptional references to the divinities appeared at approximately the same time and place as the artistic representation and exhibit a similar pattern of distribution and development. In the early sculptures there are only seven or eight planetary deities depicted: Surya, (the Sun), Candra (the Moon), Ma ngala (Mars), Budha (Mercury), Brhaspati (Jupiter), Sukra (Venus), Sani (Saturn) and sometimes Rahu (the demon of eclipses). Beginning in the early seventh century, Ketu (the personification of comets) was added to form the group known as the Nine Planetary Deities (navagraha). Except for Surya, Rahu, and Ketu, the early depictions of the divinities share an undifferentiated iconography. Images in the medieval period exhibit a more individualistic iconography, and their occurrence is more widespread.},

  abstract         = {1. Nitroglycerine (NG) was discovered in 1847 by Ascanio Sobrero in Turin, following work with Theophile-Jules Pelouze. Sobrero first noted the ‘violent headache’ produced by minute quantities of NG on the tongue.2. Constantin Hering, in 1849, tested NG in healthy volunteers, observing that headache was caused with ‘such precision’. Hering pursued NG (‘glonoine’) as a homeopathic remedy for headache, believing that its use fell within the doctrine of ‘like cures like’.3. Alfred Nobel joined Pelouze in 1851 and recognized the potential of NG. He began manufacturing NG in Sweden, overcoming handling problems with his patent detonator. Nobel suffered acutely from angina and was later to refuse NG as a treatment.4. During the mid-19th century, scientists in Britain took an interest in the newly discovered amyl nitrite, recognized as a powerful vasodilator. Lauder Brunton, the father of modern pharmacology, used the compound to relieve angina in 1867, noting the pharmacological resistance to repeated doses.5. William Murrell first used NG for angina in 1876, although NG entered the British Pharmacopoeia as a remedy for hypertension. William Martindale, the pharmaceutical chemist, prepared ‘. . . a more stable and portable preparation’: 1/100th of a grain in chocolate.6. In the early 20th century, scientists worked on in vitro actions of nitrate-containing compounds although little progress was made towards understanding the cellular mode of action.7. The NG industry flourished from 1900, exposing workers to high levels of organic nitrites; the phenomena of nitrate tolerance was recognized by the onset of ‘Monday disease’ and of nitrate-withdrawal/overcompensation by ‘Sunday Heart Attacks’.8. Ferid Murad discovered the release of nitric oxide (NO) from NG and its action on vascular smooth muscle (in 1977). Robert Furchgott and John Zawadski recognized the importance of the endothelium in acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation (in 1980) and Louis Ignarro and Salvador Moncada identified endothelial-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) as NO (in 1987).9. Glycerol trinitrate remains the treatment of choice for relieving angina; other organic esters and inorganic nitrates are also used, but the rapid action of NG and its established efficacy make it the mainstay of angina pectoris relief.},

The second is an outline of the first. two drawings, one of Vāgbhaṭa, and the other of the commentator Candranandana. The author of the work is Che rje. The work formed the basis for part of the history of medicine written by Sangs rgyas rgya mtsho. The latter author gave us a brief notice of the life and writings of Che rje. The Ah. was translated into Tibetan by Lo chen Rin chen bzang po and the Kashmiri Janārdana in AD 1015 (p.311). The tr. was done at Tho ling (Tholing monastery). The present historical work was composed in AD 1204. The main point Martin ends with is that the rGyud bzhi, 4 tantras, is heavily indebted to the Ah., perhaps more than even the studies of Emmerick 1977 etc. show. Che rje's work divides the Ah into four tantras, but doesn't know the rGyud bzhi. There are more MSS of Che rje's work around and it deserves to be edited and published},

The briefest, clearest, and most refined account of his influential approach to the subject, the book will be invaluable to all students of philosophy and physics.

Quantum mechanics holds a unique place in the history of physics. It has produced the most accurate predictions of any scientific theory, but, more astonishing, there has never been any agreement about what the theory implies about physical reality. Maudlin argues that the very term “quantum theory” is a misnomer. A proper physical theory should clearly describe what is there and what it does―yet standard textbooks present quantum mechanics as a predictive recipe in search of a physical theory.

In contrast, Maudlin explores three proper theories that recover the quantum predictions: the indeterministic wavefunction collapse theory of Ghirardi, Rimini, and Weber; the deterministic particle theory of deBroglie and Bohm; and the conceptually challenging Many Worlds theory of Everett. Each offers a radically different proposal for the nature of physical reality, but Maudlin shows that none of them are what they are generally taken to be.},

Its far-ranging instructions on state activities depict an ideal-typical kingdom heavily reliant on computation, particularly with respect to state finances. Nevertheless, computational practices themselves are little discussed, and no general study of them in the Arthaśāstra yet exists. This chapter is a primarily philological effort to frame an initial inquiry into such practices in the text through a study of the terms through which computation is expressed or implied. After introducing the Arthaśāstra, I examine: 1. various means of assigning value as laid out in the text (including an overview of mensuration in the Arthaśāstra); 2. some of the most prevalent numerical operations and procedures; 3. the use of these in a few examples of state activities; and 4. how computation was conceived among other evaluative activities.},

  abstract  = {This book examines the history and evolution of Ayurveda and other indigenous medical traditions in juxtaposition with their encounter with colonial modernity. Through the lens of hereditary folk and Ayurvedic practitioners, it focuses on Kerala’s heterogeneous medical traditions and presents them against the backdrop of the geographical, historical, sociocultural, ethnographic and regional contexts in which they developed and transformed. The author explores the world of Kerala’s last traditionally trained hereditary practitioners (folk healers, poison therapists, Sanskrit-speaking Muslim Ayurvedic practitioners and the legendary Brahman Ashtavaidyan physicians). He discusses the views of these physicians regarding the marked difference between their personalised ancestral methods of treatment and the standardised version of Ayurveda compliant with biomedicine that is practised by doctors today. Drawing on extensive fieldwork, this book will be useful to researchers and scholars of medical anthropology, health and social medicine, sociology and social anthropology, the history of science and modern Indian history, as well as to medical practitioners interested in alternative and traditional medicine.},

Viewed against this background the paucity of studies on theoretical concepts is astonishing. By far the larger majority of writings on Indian medicine, in particular those by Indian authors, are concerned with practice and its justification, not with its theoretical basis. Studies on philosophical concepts that form an integral part of medical thought form an exception. This state of the art, though regrettable, is easily understandable. The theory of āyurveda is intricate, the differences of opinion on all kinds of topics are numerous and the basic concepts together with the ways in which they are interconnected are far from transparent.},

  volume           = {16},
  annotation       = {The history of the Portuguese conquest of Ceylon and its fate (a short lived one as compared with that of Goa) has been amply documented in the works of Paul E. Pieris (Ceylon, the Portuguese Era, 1913-- 14), Tikiri Abeyasinghe (Portuguese Rule in Ceylon, 1966), C.R. Boxer (The Portuguese Seaborne Empire, 1969), Chandra R. de Silva (The Portuguese in Ceylon, 1972) and George D. Winius (The Fatal History of Portuguese Ceylon, 1978). However, the paradox of a long enduring Portuguese influence on Sri Lankan culture in spite of the short duration of the political domination has never been fully explored. This book intends to address the issue and fill a gap in our knowledge of the cultural history of Asia. Its value lies in the use of Portuguese creole texts either available in the Hugh Neville Collection kept at the British Library, or recently collected by the author and others among the so-called 'Portuguese Burgher' and 'Kaffir' communities in Batticaloa and Puttalam. In the first five sections, the reader is provided with a useful but rather patchy overview of the impact of the Portuguese on administration, education, religion, onomastics, dress, cuisine, furniture, and fine arts; the text is interspersed with lists of names and illustrated with translations from Portuguese creole popular poetry and songs. The rest of the book (actually three quarters of it) is devoted to the translation in standard Portuguese and in English of the corpus of the Neville manuscript Portuguese creole texts. Coming after a previous attempt by K.D. Jackson in Sing Without Shame. Oral Traditions in Indo-Portuguese Creole Verse (Amsterdam, 1990) which was considered unsatisfying, this text provides the reader with the basic sources for the knowledge of cultural breeding between Sri Lankan (either Sinhala or Tamil), Portuguese, and African 'Kaffir' folk poetry and music, dancing and theatre, although these latter aspects are not fully addressed in the introductory commentary of the text itself, but rather in the previous more general chapters. What remains to be done is a textual and historical study of that rich corpus, keeping in mind that while determining a chronology is an impossible task so far as oral literature is concerned (see the mentions of Pondicherry and of ``Garibaldi" in the second text which point to late accretions!), intertextual reading provides a useful tool. In that respect, a precise study of the last and longest text (the story of Ourson and Valentine) could possibly yield a large harvest of information regarding how a mediaeval European legend is reinterpreted in a Portuguese colonial context.

  abstract             = {The Yoga Sutra, dating from about the third century A.D., distills the essentials of a complex system of physical and spiritual discipline into 200 brief aphorisms. Yoga is at the heart of all meditative practice in Asia, yet until now there has been no first-rate English version of this primary text. Barbara Stoler Miller's translation admirably fills that gap--her clear, strong style and sensitive phrasing convey every nuance of Patanjali's words, and her commentary offers invaluable guidance to anyone seeking to understand Indian philosophy or the practice of yoga. The Yoga Sutra does not propose to offer new knowledge but rather a new perspective on the nature of knowing. As a method of achieving insight, the discipline of yoga is far from mystical ecstasy or ritual trance. Its goal is a contemplative intensity that can unbind the constraints of everyday experience, and that goal helps explain Americans' growing interest in yoga in recent years. This interest has been most widely expressed in the physical dimension of yoga--the postures known as hatha-yoga--but attention is increasingly being directed at the philosophy and psychology that define the discipline. Here the Yoga Sutra shines most brightly; in a world of bewildering complexity and seductive material culture, this centuries-old text offers powerful techniques for countering private mental chaos and moral confusion. The Yoga Sutra has great relevance today, and thanks to Barbara Stoler Miller it is now truly accessible.},

Premodern hospitals, according to many scholars, existed mainly as refuges for the desperately poor and sick, providing patients with little or no medical care. Challenging this view in a compelling survey of hospitals in the East Roman Empire, Timothy Miller traces the birth and development of Byzantine <I>xenones</I>, or hospitals, from their emergence in the fourth century to their decline in the fifteenth century, just prior to the Turkish conquest of Constantinople. These sophisticated medical facilities, he concludes, are the true ancestors of modern hospitals. In a new introduction to this paperback edition, Miller describes the growing scholarship on this subject in recent years.},

Yet we know that often enough, things do happen after placebo administration. Among various causes for such change, I attribute some effects to the meanings the placebos convey to the participants in the medical event — the doctors, nurses, patients, family, community, etc., of the patient. I call these \"meaning responses,\" and survey here some of the ways they occur (with or without the presence of placebos). Then, I describe some recent studies which dramatically complicate the interpretation of RCTs, and our perhaps overly simplistic understandings of the nature of medical efficacy.},

Indeed, many of the technical procedures that emerged in the area, such as infinite series expansions for various mathematical relations predated those that were developed with the advent of the Calculus, but notably in contrasting intellectual circumstances with distinctly different epistemic priorities. We examine some of the features of this tradition and the context in which they flourished.},

It was not until the late 1990s, however, that this became a thriving area of historical research. As work in the area has grown exponentially over the past decade and a half, many of the older frameworks of analysis have been critiqued and modified. Most recent scholarship in the field clearly expresses symptoms of the dis-ease with many of the well-entrenched frameworks. This essay, by no means exhaustive, charts some of the major themes and approaches which have dominated the histories of ‘indigenous’ medicines in South Asia and signals the dis-eases with them.},

  abstract         = {Like many of the traditional medicines of South Asia, Ayurvedic practice changed dramatically in the later nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. With "Doctoring Tradition", Projit Bihari Mukharji offers a close look at that transformation, upending the widely held yet little-examined belief that it was the result of the introduction of Western anatomical knowledge and cadaveric dissection. Rather, Mukharji reveals, what instigated those changes were a number of small technologies that were introduced in the period by Ayurvedic physicians, men who were simultaneously Victorian gentlemen and members of a particular Bengali caste. The introduction of these devices, including thermometers, watches, and microscopes, Mukharji shows, ultimately led to a dramatic reimagining of the body. The new Ayurvedic body that thus emerged by the 1930s, while different from the biomedical body, was nonetheless largely compatible with it. The more incompatible elements of the old Ayurvedic body were then rendered therapeutically indefensible and impossible to imagine in practice.0The new Ayurvedic medicine, therefore, was the product not of an embrace of Western approaches, but of a creative attempt to develop a viable alternative to the Western tradition by braiding together elements drawn from both the West and the East.},

  abstract  = {In 1912, Bihar and Orissa was carved out of the erstwhile Bengal Presidency as a separate Province. The next year saw the beginnings of one of the most lavishly financed archaeological excavations of colonial India in the new province—the Pataliputra excavations funded by Ratan Tata and supervised, on behalf of the Archaeological Survey of India, by D.B. Spooner. The excavations discovered Patna, the new Provincial capital, as the ancient city of Pataliputra. This essay traces the history of archaeological excavations at Patna between 1913 and 1918. However, it does not engage with Pataliputra as a pre-given, physically available site, which could be discovered through archaeological excavations. Against the backdrop of provincial reconfigurations across Bengal, Bihar and Orissa in the opening decades of the twentieth century, the paper explores the politics of place-making and provincial self-fashioning in early twentieth-century colonial Bihar. It maps how Pataliputra was brought into being through the place-making labours of colonial archaeology. And in tracking the different and changing trajectories of making Patna Pataliputra, the essay unearths how nationalist identities were deeply imbricated in the same disciplinary and institutional spaces opened up by colonial archaeological and museum practices.},

Key concepts for the new history are examined through the ideas of leading historians and philosophers since the eighteenth century such as Kant, Nietzsche, Croce, Collingwood, White, Foucault and Derrida including: class; empiricism, hermeneutics, inference, metanarrative, relativism; and teleology. With an introduction setting out the state of the discipline of history today and alphabetical entries on the key ideas, issues and concepts, The Routledge Companion to Historical Studies explores the exciting challenges that history faces in the late twentieth century.}},

The interactions of all three people for long periods in history are well documented; the study raises the obviously intriguing question why in some areas they influenced each other markedly but not at all in others. No doubt it is the first study on the subject and a number of aspects brought up for discussion may be new and original altogether. This study might raise few issues owing to looking at events from different perspectives because much of the history has no validity of its chronology and the mist of mythology is too thick. The narrative endeavours to engage support from reliable references and quotes from dependable sources.},

  abstract         = {The genetic formation of Central and South Asian populations has been unclear because of an absence of ancient DNA. To address this gap, we generated genome-wide data from 362 ancient individuals, including the first from eastern Iran, Turan (Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan), Bronze Age Kazakhstan, and South Asia. Our data reveal a complex set of genetic sources that ultimately combined to form the ancestry of South Asians today. We document a southward spread of genetic ancestry from the Eurasian Steppe, correlating with the archaeologically known expansion of pastoralist sites from the Steppe to Turan in the Middle Bronze Age (2300-1500 BCE). These Steppe communities mixed genetically with peoples of the Bactria Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC) whom they encountered in Turan (primarily descendants of earlier agriculturalists of Iran), but there is no evidence that the main BMAC population contributed genetically to later South Asians. Instead, Steppe communities integrated farther south throughout the 2nd millennium BCE, and we show that they mixed with a more southern population that we document at multiple sites as outlier individuals exhibiting a distinctive mixture of ancestry related to Iranian agriculturalists and South Asian hunter-gathers. We call this group Indus Periphery because they were found at sites in cultural contact with the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) and along its northern fringe, and also because they were genetically similar to post-IVC groups in the Swat Valley of Pakistan. By co-analyzing ancient DNA and genomic data from diverse present-day South Asians, we show that Indus Periphery-related people are the single most important source of ancestry in South Asia — consistent with the idea that the Indus Periphery individuals are providing us with the first direct look at the ancestry of peoples of the IVC — and we develop a model for the formation of present-day South Asians in terms of the temporally and geographically proximate sources of Indus Periphery-related, Steppe, and local South Asian hunter-gatherer-related ancestry. Our results show how ancestry from the Steppe genetically linked Europe and South Asia in the Bronze Age, and identifies the populations that almost certainly were responsible for spreading Indo-European languages across much of Eurasia.},

  abstract         = {This contribution to the Common Knowledge symposium “Fuzzy Studies” explores the boundaries between religions by exploring the ambiguous place of yoga in various religious traditions, both modern and premodern. Recently, certain Hindus and Christians have tried to argue that yoga is an essentially Hindu practice, making their case by appealing to the Yoga Sutras, a text by the Sanskrit author Patanjali. However, on closer examination, the Yoga Sutras seem to exist in a fuzzy, indeterminate space that is not quite “Hindu” in the way the word is understood today. For instance, other Sanskrit authors of the first millennium CE criticized Patanjali's yoga teachings for not being properly theistic and for having strong affinities to Buddhism and Jainism. Yoga was also integrated into at least one of the “religions of the book” in the medieval period: in India in the second millennium, yoga was practiced widely among Sufis, who adapted it in surprising and idiosyncratic ways to make it compatible with their own Islamic philosophies. Nicholson concludes with an appeal for a more nuanced understanding of religious contact that goes beyond the pejorative term syncretism to acknowledge that religious mixing has been a central force in the development not only of Hinduism and Islam, but also of Christianity.},

The negotiation process is initiated by the posing of rhetorical questions about somatic and affective states and structured by a conceptual framework which relegates such states to humoral interrelationships. By establishing a humoral explanatory model for an illness episode or affective state which takes into account environmental and constitutional factors over which one has little control, responsibility is mollified and dialogue about personal problems eased. A comparison of the interaction between ayurvedic practitioners and patients and astrologers and clients is made in this regard. The socially integrative and adaptive consequences of ayurvedic therapy is considered vis a vis a portrayal of a popular vaidya's therapy for a number of illnesses associated with the somatization of psychosocial stress.},

To illustrate this point the case of South Kanarese Havik Brahmin women is presented. These women are described as having a weak social support network and limited opportunities to ventilate feelings and seek counsel outside the household. Alternative means of expressing psychosocial distress resorted to by Havik women are discussed in relation to associated Brahminic values, norms and stereotypes. Somatization is focused upon as an important idiom through which distress is communicated. Idioms of distress more peripheral to the personal or cultural behavioral repertoire of Havik women are considered as adaptive responses in circumstances where other modes of expression fail to communicate distress adequately or provide appropriate coping strategies. The importance of an lsquoidioms of distressrsquo approach to psychiatric evaluation is noted.},

  language         = {English},
  abstract         = {Conventionally, the label "classical yoga"  has been aligned to, and sometimes conflated with, the text of Patañjali's Yogasūtra, produced in the 4th-5th century. Yet if we broaden the scope of inspection to a wider textual corpus from the same period, we can identify a richer and more complex discourse of classical yoga, which is also employed in Buddhist traditions and which is semantically entangled across religious boundaries. In particular, this study focuses on dialogic interaction between three contemporaneous texts via the use of shared metaphorical systems to explain theories of liberation. There are a number of close correspondences, hitherto unexplored, between the soteriology of the Pātañjalayogaśāstra and both the Sautrāntika positions in the Abhidharmakośabhāṣya and the earliest textual layers of the Yogācārabhūmiśāstra. I draw on conceptual metaphor theory to demonstrate how yoga, yogācāra, and Sautrāntika constructed their soteriology under the broad metaphorical banner of bhāvanā qua cultivation. Bhāvanā is a complex orientational metaphor that was adapted by these different religious traditions because it could encompass both "cessative"  and "aspirational"  aspects of yogic practice, as reflected in the spatially polarised metaphors of the seed in the earth and the cloud in the sky. There are also close overlaps in the ontologies of these three textual traditions. The dialogic relationship between Brahmanical and Buddhist yoga soteriology indicates a need to re-assess which texts are included under the rubric of "classical yoga" and to foreground the role of yogācāra and its śāstra in this category.},

  abstract         = {\begin{quote} The history of composite religious cultures in India has over recent decades attracted much more consistent attention than the history of syncretic political and intellectual cultures. During the 1970s and 1980s, when the study of pre-colonial India drew greater numbers of scholars than has been the case more recently, a number of historians of the Mughal north concerned themselves with the means by which Akbar and his political allies were able to draw into imperial service a very disparate range of ethnic groups---Irani, Turani, Afghan, Rajput, Indian Muslim, high-caste Hindu scribalists---and to generate for them a new corporate and inclusivist ideology of service to emperor and state. John Richards has described how a powerful dynastic ideology, formulated by Akbar's close friend and servant Abu'l Fazl in his monumental history of the empire the Akbar-Nama, and given dramatic public expression in the ceremonial of the imperial court, glorified Akbar as the living embodiment of the Empire itself, and focus for the direct personal devotion of the imperial nobility. Stephen Blake has drawn out the importance of patrimonial themes in the techniques which Akbar and his successors devised to maintain the sense of a personal familial bond between the emperor and his servants. Historians of Mughal administration such as M. Athar Ali have explored the ways in which the systematisation of mansab grants and appointments to offices under Akbar provided a common framework within which imperial servants from different backgrounds could seek advancement. With a different emphasis again, Mughal art historians have drawn attention to Akbar's intense interest in the power of images as a means of communicating new understandings of the nature of kingship and its place in the natural and social worlds, particularly through the dazzling illustrations for the Akbar-Nama produced in Akbar's imperial atelier. S.A.A. Rizvi and Peter Hardy have focussed on the role of Abu'l Fazl in helping to project, through the massive illuminated history of his Akbar-Nama, a new and more inclusive style of rulership for Akbar, which drew on sufi and medieval ishraqi theories of the divine illumination of kingship. This presented Akbar as insan-i kamil, ``the perfect man," whose inner virtues of justice, self-control and renunciation of worldly attachments enabled him to attain the divine blessing of sulh-i kull, an attitude of universal concord and toleration.\footnote{I am very grateful to Muzaffar Alam, Chris Bayly, Sunil Ku{3}, Sanjay Subrahmanyam, and David Washbrook for their constructive criticisms of this paper.

  abstract         = {The question ‘Who is a Brahman?’ was the focus of sustained and intense debate among the many small and competing Brahman communities of western India's Konkan littoral during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. This debate ranged over history, lineage, reputation, social relationships, modes of livelihood and customary practices. It was conducted along the intellectual and social networks that linked the shrine towns and sacred centres of the Maratha country with the Maratha pandit communities of Banaras, then engaged in their own allied discussions about the nature of early modern India's social order. More locally, puranic and allied genres of narrative history engaged with the same question, offering competing versions of the origins and moral qualities of the region's Brahman communities. The appropriateness of the different kinds of agricultural work and petty trade common amongst them lay at the heart of these debates. As the region's Brahman communities began to define themselves as a new kind of scribal and administrative elite in the early modern period, and to compete for the advantages and resources that such service livelihoods offered, associations with menial work became a key discursive marker of Brahman unfitness. These new definitions of Brahman standing and entitlement reached their culmination under the Maratha government of the peshwas.},

  abstract = {The research into the dietary habits of a country and its people is a large part of the anthropologist's work. Some of them have specialised themselves in interpreting the dietary taboos and restrictions written in the old scriptures. It has been recognized for a long time that dietary habits are at the basis of social structures and relationships and that the studying of these habits is an important element of understanding a culture. The classic Indian 'Dharma' literature gives much attention to food: what animals and plants can or cannot be eaten, from which people are you allowed to receive food, and what terms decide whether or not a foodtype is or isn't qualified for consumption. In this book Olivelle speaks about two subjects. First he takes a closer look at two terms central to the discussion about dietary rules: the Sanscrit words 'abhaksya' and 'abhojya' which translate to forbidden (abhaksya) and unsuitable (abhojya). Then he takes a closer look at the list concerning these two types of prescribed food which can be found in several classical books on law in India. Finally Olivelle reviews the types of key elements found in the dietary rules of Ancient India.},

  abstract         = {Bhāvanā, “bringing into being,” is one of Mīmāṃsā’s hallmark concepts. It connects text and action in a single structure of meaning. This conjunction was crucially important to Mīmāṃsā’s own interpretive enterprise, and functioned— controversially but influentially—in a broader theory of language. The goal of this paper is to outline bhāvanā’s major contours as it is developed by Kumārilabhaṭṭa and some his followers (Maṇḍanamiśra, Pārthasārathimiśra, Someśvarabhaṭṭa, Khaṇḍadeva, and Āpadeva) and to examine some of the arguments they marshaled in support of it. Bhāvanā is shown to open up, for these Mīmāṃsakas, an understanding of the “deep structure” of Vedic injunctions and the vocabulary for systematically representing it; it accounts for both what people do when they perform an action that is enjoined (ārthī bhāvanā) and what the injunction itself does when it motivates people to performance (śābdī bhāvanā). Bhāvanā has resonances with, and relevance to, contemporary discussions of the nexus of language, understanding, and action, and its value as a carefully-elaborated concept of hermeneutical significance should not be overlooked.},

  abstract  = {Introduction: Education in the field of Ayurveda is regulated by the Central Council of Indian Medicine (CCIM). The weightage of Sanskrit subject in first Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and surgery (BAMS) course has been decreased from 250 marks to 100 marks by CCIM notification in 2012. Decrease in weightage of marks of Sanskrit subject from 250 marks to 100 marks may affect the knowledge of Sanskrit subject.

Aims: To established a causal relationship between knowledge of Sanskrit language and results of Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery examination.

Material and methods: Comparisons of knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) scores and average marks in BAMS examination of two groups of students of 2nd and 3rd year BAMS and who have passed 1st year BAMS professional examination with Sanskrit subject of either 250 marks or 100 marks regarding were done. The relationship between prior exposure to Sanskrit at school level and average marks in BAMS examinations was also assessed through this study. It was a cross-sectional KAP questionnaire study. KAP questionnaire to assess KAP toward Sanskrit subject was developed and was reviewed by expert faculties. A total of 200 students of various Ayurvedic colleges from Mumbai and Navi Mumbai were enrolled in the study. The data was analyzed by appropriate statistical tests.

Results and observation: It was observed that in spite of decrease in weightage of marks of Sanskrit subject, there was no significant difference in KAP score as well as average marks in BAMS examination in both the groups. There was significant difference in number of students who had studied Sanskrit subject and who had not studied it at school level. There were significant differences in KAP score and average marks in BAMS examination in those two groups.

Conclusion: Students who have studied Sanskrit at school level find it easier to get good marks in BAMS examination, and particularly Sanskrit subject. Due to less weightage of Sanskrit subject, although syllabus is not decreased to that extent; there is very limited scope to ask various questions to judge the understanding level of students. Existing or previous syllabus of Sanskrit do not make any difference in understanding of subject and also in marks in University examination.},

This essay also explores how Nainsi's early enumeration of caste data, and other precolonial human inventories that followed upon it, helped shape the first known colonial census of western Rajasthan, undertaken by Alexander Boileau in 1835 in Marwar and the adjacent kingdoms of Bahawalpur, Bikaner, and Jaisalmer. One goal will be to redirect scholarly attention to some native agenda that may have been institutionalized and advanced by this nominal way of `knowing the country' both during the late precolonial and early colonial eras. Without positing an easy continuity from the precolonial to the colonial in terms of forms of knowledge and attendant institutions, this essay will suggest that colonial discourses often built upon indigenous ones in ways that inflected [reflected?] local politics about which the British initially were only dimly aware and indirectly concerned, but which later had a major impact on the constitution of colonial rule.},

  annotation       = {A distinguished scholar of early modem Asian and European interaction in the Indian Ocean, M.N. Pearson turns his attention in the present book to East Africa and to the network of Swahili coastal societies. The work seeks to explore and define the cultural, racial, and ethnic identities of the Swahili settlements, to define their place in the broader history of the Indian Ocean prior to the arrival of the Portuguese, and to capture the changes caused by the Portuguese in the sixteenth century.\\ In more general terms, the book seeks to place the Swahili coast in the context of early modern world history, using Wallerstenian world-system theory. The world-system approach is complemented, and often greatly extended, through an analysis of spatial structures moulded in the tradition of the seminal works of K.N. Chaudhuri and other historians of the Indian Ocean inspired by the Braudel school. The purpose of the work is thus double: it seeks to present a history of the interaction between the Swahili coast, the western Indian Ocean, and the African interior; and to test the usefulness of world-system theory in positioning the Swahili civilization in a world-historical context, in the era of the emergence of mercantile capitalism and European hegemony.\\ The long introduction (29 out of the total 167 pages of text) defines the terms of discourse, outlines the theoretical framework of the topic, and offers a critique of sources. It provides a fascinating insight into the various pitfalls encountered by scholars willing to venture simultaneously into such broad, challenging, and often idiosyncratic fields as the history of Africa, India, Islam, Portugal, and the European oceanic expansion. Pearson addresses diverse methodological biases, both past and present, the issue of availability and provenance of sources, and the uneven coverage of the area under consideration.},

Alchemy, whose tradition had been broken in the West at the end of the Hellenistic age, gained considerable attention—albeit less than astronomy/astrology and medicine—from the twelfth-century translators, who presented Latin culture with a hitherto unknown doctrine that was completely different from any other science. Alchemy, as the Latin Middle Ages received it, is the philosophical search for the agent of material perfection by means of the manipulation of base materials. It thereby united theory and practice in a way unexpected by Latin scholars. In fact, alchemy as a doctrine was inseparable from laboratory practice; and this practice so much resembled well-established craftsmen's labor that for a long period the place of alchemy in the divisio disciplinarum wavered between the mechanical and the liberal arts},

  abstract = {Since its introduction in the Latin West, alchemy vehiculated an idea of
Arab-Islamic origin, i.e. that transmutation encompassed a higher secret
than the mere contents of laboratory practice, metallurgical knowledge,
and even theoretical reflection over doctrines rooted in manual operation
– quite a challenge to Aristotelian epistemology. Such higher secret,
announced in the aphorisms of the Tabula smaragdina, was called elixir in
several Arab-Islamic texts, that developed the idea of a deep and mysteri-
ous involvement of the alchemical transformations with the secrets of
cosmos and life. Precisely this notion of elixir was the focus of the pseudo-
Avicennan De anima in arte alchemiae in which, as also in the jabirian Liber
misericordiae, medicinal properties began to be associated to the elixir itself.
Both texts were widely read by Western scholars, and they were sources for
Roger Bacon’s claim that alchemy, medicine and natural philosophy con-
cern one and the same field of nature’s dynamics. Thus the elixir became
the very goal of alchemical research in a development of it (the so-called
«alchemy of the elixir»), which reached its climax in the early Fourteenth
century: the Testamentum attributed to Raimond Lull and the Rosarius
philosophorum attributed to Arnald of Villanova were its main vehicles in
later alchemy until Paracelsus. A third author, associated to pseudo-Lull and
pseudo-Arnald by alchemical tradition, was the English alchemist John
Dastin, on whom recent research calls attention, showing that his works –
where his debt to Arabic sources is outspoken – might be the very first tes-
timony to the transition towards the «alchemy of the elixir» (or «medical
alchemy»).},

  abstract  = {Geometry is the earliest recorded branch of Indian mathematics. Mathematics of the Vedic period consists of those geometric techniques needed for the construction of the altars and fire-places described by the priestly hereditary class for the performance of their rites. The link between geometry and ritual suggests that mathematical accuracy was considered of the utmost importance in this context. The study of rational figures in the Sanskrit work Gaṇita Sāra Saṃgraha, to which Mahāvīrācārya, a ninth-century ce Jaina mathematician, dedicates a special treatment, reveals striking parallelism with the earlier geometry developed in connection with the Vedic sacrifice. Mahāvīra makes extensive use of the uddeśaka or ‘sample problem’, and I suggest a new way of interpreting the uddeśaka as a significant device for constructing an ‘actual proof’ which validates and links a mathematical rule to its unmentioned premises and provides a system of knowledge based on deductive syllogism.},

The Aṇuogaddārāiṃ (approximately 4th century CE), a Prakrit text from the Śvetāmbara Āgamas, explains the methods a Jaina monk should use in investigating a scriptural text. This work shows a remarkable ability to deal with numerical concepts and quantitative descriptions of all kinds. I shall often compare its mathematical content with texts from different Sanskrit bodies of knowledge. This paper demonstrates that the Aṇuogaddārāiṃ, as well as presenting a wealth of mathematical information, expounds a Jaina theory of numbers that has been so far disregarded by historiography. In order to understand this formulation, I shall propose an analytical-interpretative model to then improve the English translation by Hanaki 1970. In Jainism, the knowledge of the true nature of the universe was a requisite to progressing towards a full awareness of the human condition and hence towards the path of liberation. Numerical data and detailed calculations provide minute descriptions of the universe and matters related to karma and liberation. I shall argue that the Aṇuogaddārāiṃ testifies that mathematics was a perfect, functional instrument for representing Jaina cosmological and soteriological models.},

The Cāṇakyaṭīkā has not yet been fully studied nor translated into English. This paper presents the first English translation and analysis of the passages in which Prabhamati comments upon the activities of the “superintendent of the mint” (lakṣaṇādhyakṣa) and of the “examiner of coins” (rūpadarśaka). His exposition on Arthaśāstra 2.12.24–25 provides an interesting example of what can be defined as a “textual variation”; by means of commentarial techniques and literary devices the author stretches the structure of the root-text. On the basis of a broad analysis, this research demonstrates that the commentator quotes a passage on the coinage system from an unnamed source which, I shall argue, is the authoritative treatise on law Mānava Dharmaśāstra (2nd – 3rd century ce). This represents further evidence of the relationship between the Arthaśāstra and Manu's code. Finally, I shall suggest Bhikṣu Prabhamati's date and place of origin.},

  abstract  = {The aim of this article is to bring to light the determining role played by quantification for early Jain monastic intellectuals. Jaina philosophy of space-time attempts to fix in a finely elaborated numerical structure the model of the Universe and the whole system of reality. In discussions about the sophisticated mathematical practices characterizing Jaina sources, the achievements realized by highly elaborate formulae have been variously emphasized. An aspect that has been thus far disregarded by historiography is the reasoning behind mathematical modes of enquiry. Therefore, there is a need to investigate the relationship between the way Jaina thinkers expounded philosophical issues and the use of quantifying procedures. Everything imaginable that could be quantified was computed: the numbers of individuals among different kinds of beings in the various regions of the three worlds, the extent of their lifespans, the volumes of space occupied by living beings of various shapes, and other matters. I shall argue that in Jainism, mathematics is a fundamental expedient of philosophical enquiry. Textual evidence from religious-philosophical works will be presented to demonstrate that, for Jainas, quantification responds to a ‘quest for order’: the intellectual and spiritual ambition to recognize in nature structured and predictable patterns.},

The aim is to understand the role played in contemporary India by traditional knowledge of astral science. For this purpose, I shall investigate the information provided by a modern Hindi pañcāṅga. This denotes a traditional almanac that goes back to a well-established practice of calendar making attested in Sanskrit literature. In medieval India, the pañcāṅga forecasted celestial phenomena such as the weather and solar eclipses and was commonly used to establish the dates for religious festivals, to know auspicious moments to undertake activities such as trading, marriage, traveling, and to set up the performance of vratas (religious ceremonies) and saṃskāras (Hindu initiation rituals at important occasions of life). Different versions of pañcāṅgas are published nowadays in all the Indian regional languages and even in English by jyotiṣīs or ‘astrologers’. Since early times, festivals, rituals, and religious ceremonies have been marked in India lunar months and the passage of the seasons. The present paper shows that astrology still plays a major part in every sphere of human life and that, in the course of a month, the changing phases of the moon coincide with the ritual observance of ancient religious practices.},

Science is ideology to be unraveled and exposed—as modernity and progress making or violence and oppression making—depending on where you stand on the interpretive spectrum. It has been seen as ideologically driven practice, as a mode of knowledge production whose history is inseparable from the social and political uses to which it is tethered. In the colonial as well as the postcolonial context, science and technology have been seen as the “ideology of empire,” “tools of empire,” “tentacles of progress,” and “reasons of state.” Yet science and technology are practices and bodies of knowledge that inhabitants of the subcontinent have engaged with enthusiasm, that they have used to invent themselves in their global, national, and individual lives. We know remarkably little about the histories of these complex engagements. A departure from current historiographical preoccupations is called for to map and explain the lives, institutions, practices, and stories of science on the subcontinent as they connect with, and where they break away from, the world at large.},

He traces the two great moments of its transformation: the first around the beginning of the Common Era, when Sanskrit, long a sacred language, was reinvented as a code for literary and political expression, the start of an amazing career that saw Sanskrit literary culture spread from Afghanistan to Java. The second moment occurred around the beginning of the second millennium, when local speech forms challenged and eventually replaced Sanskrit in both the literary and political arenas. Drawing striking parallels, chronologically as well as structurally, with the rise of Latin literature and the Roman empire, and with the new vernacular literatures and nation-states of late-medieval Europe, <i>The Language of the Gods in the World of Men</i> asks whether these very different histories challenge current theories of culture and power and suggest new possibilities for practice.},

  abstract         = {This investigation of the overwhelming appeal of quantification in the modern world discusses the development of cultural meanings of objectivity over two centuries. How are we to account for the current prestige and power of quantitative methods? The usual answer is that quantification is seen as desirable in social and economic investigation as a result of its successes in the study of nature. Theodore Porter is not content with this. Why should the kind of success achieved in the study of stars, molecules, or cells be an attractive model for research on human societies? he asks. And, indeed, how should we understand the pervasiveness of quantification in the sciences of nature? In his view, we should look in the reverse direction: comprehending the attractions of quantification in business, government, and social research will teach us something new about its role in psychology, physics, and medicine.

Drawing on a wide range of examples from the laboratory and from the worlds of accounting, insurance, cost-benefit analysis, and civil engineering, Porter shows that it is "exactly wrong" to interpret the drive for quantitative rigor as inherent somehow in the activity of science except where political and social pressures force compromise. Instead, quantification grows from attempts to develop a strategy of impersonality in response to pressures from outside. Objectivity derives its impetus from cultural contexts, quantification becoming most important where elites are weak, where private negotiation is suspect, and where trust is in short supply.},

  abstract  = {Debates over how Tibetan history should be construed have raged for centuries and have been particularly intense in recent years. Chinese historians wish to construct a narrative that gives them a right to be in Tibet and that justifies China’s record since its takeover in the 1950s. Tibetan historians offer a very different picture, one that excludes China and pushes it to the periphery and derives Tibet’s history and culture from indigenous sources and India. One of the main contributions of this book is its exploration of the ideology that underlies China’s concern with Tibet and its willingness to invest huge sums of money and attract worldwide criticism for its treatment of the Tibetan people. The author argues that the roots of Chinese attitudes lie in the Nationalist period (1911–1947), when public pronouncements and school textbooks declared that Tibet is the “back door to China” and that Western imperialists were plotting to conquer Tibet, which would later be a staging ground for invasion of interior China. The book looks at the key points of Tibetan history and how each side constructs them as part of a larger narrative, beginning with the marriage of the Tibetan king Songtsen Gambo in the 7th century to a Chinese princess. One important conclusion is that both sides agree on the main aspects of what happened, but disagree fundamentally on the psychological motives they attribute to historical figures. Where Chinese historians portray Tibetan historical figures as Chinese patriots seeking greater integration with the Chinese motherland, Tibetan historians tend to view them as devout Buddhists with purely religious motives},

  abstract         = {To ask how the “third world writes its own history” appears, at first glance, to be exceedingly naive. At best, it reaffirms the East–West and Orient–Occident oppositions that have shaped historical writings and seems to be a simple-minded gesture of solidarity. Furthermore, in apparently privileging the writings of historians with third-world origins, this formulation renders such scholars into “native informants” whose discourse is opened up for further disquisitions on how “they” think of “their” history. In short, the notion of the third world writing its own history seems to reek of essentialism. Seen in another way, this formulation can be construed as positing that the third world has a fixed space of its own from which it can speak in a sovereign voice. For many, this notion of a separate terrain is rendered problematic by the increasing rapidity and the voracious appetite with which the postmodern culture imperializes and devours spaces.},

The study of travel writing has, however, remained either naively celebratory or dismissive, treating texts as symptoms of imperial ideologies.<br> <br> <b></b><b><i>Imperial Eyes</i></b> explores European travel and exploration writing, in connection with European economic and political expansion since 1700. It is both a study in genre, and a critique of ideology. Pratt examines how travel books by Europeans create the domestic subject of European imperialism, and how they engage metropolitan reading publics with expansionist enterprises whose material benefits accrued mainly to the very few. These questions are addressed through readings of particular travel accounts connected with particular historical transitions, from the eighteenth century to Paul Theroux: sentimental travel writing and its links with abolitionist rhetoric, discursive reinventions of South America during the period of its independence (1800--1840), and eighteenth-century European writings on Southern Africa in the context of inland expansion.</P>}},

  abstract         = {During the last half-century, scholarly Buddhological inquiry has produced a series of utterly stunning publications on the period immediately following the Buddha's death, focusing especially on the early councils. Through the work of Paul Demieville, Marcel Hofinger, Erich Frauwallner, Etienne Lamotte, Andre Bareau, and myself, (1) the once mysterious history of the early Buddhist councils became clearer. Bareau's Les premiers conciles bouddhiques and my own "A Review of Scholarship on the Buddhist Councils," carefully detail all the specific events of the first, second, and third councils, as well as the non-canonical council which occurred between the second and third council, and which was the occasion for the beginning of Buddhist sectarianism. Further work by Janice Nattier and me refined Bareau's presumptions in Les sects bouddhiques du petit vehicule, and offered what has now become the definitive statement of the beginnings of Buddhist sectarianism, arguing that the initial sanghabheda focused solely on matters of Vinaya, but rather than representing disciplinary laxity on the part of the future Mahasamghikas, resulted from attempted Vinaya expansion on the part of the future Sthaviras ("Mahasamghika" 237-272). (2)

In 1988, however, all the hard sought certainty that the above research seemingly promised disappeared in the aftermath of a major Buddhist symposium convened by Heinz Bechert at the University of Gottingen. Bechert had become convinced that the widely accepted dating of the historical Buddha, placing his life between 563 and 483 B.C.E., was incorrect. His symposium brought together scholars from throughout the world to examine this issue from every position, discipline, and language imaginable. Anthropologists, sociologists, art historians, philosophers, and historians compared their perspectives. Epigraphical evidence was examined. Although the symposium participants offered dates for the Buddha's death ranging from 483 B.C.E. down to 368 B.C.E., most participants suggested that the Buddha died within approximately a few decades on either side of 400 B.C.E. Eventually three volumes entitled Die Datierung des Historischen Buddha were produced, diligently edited by Bechert.

On the surface, this new dating for the Buddha's death doesn't seem ter-ribly earthshaking, either for Indian Buddhist history or for ancillary stu-dies such as a consideration of Upali and his lineage of Vinayadharas. Yet it is. Because of this new date for the Buddha's demise, virtually everything we know about the earliest Indian Buddhism, and especially its sectarian movement, is once again called into question. Dates for the first, second, and third canonical councils--once thought to be certain--must now be reexamined. Kings who presided at these events must be reconsidered. Most importantly, the role of the great Indian King Asoka, from whose reign much of the previous dating begins, needs to be placed under the scrutiny of the historical microscope again},
  annotation       = {Good overview of the whole debate. Agrees most with Gombrich. Buddha died in 404 BC. King Asoka's 13th edict mentions the Hellenistic monarchs ruling at his time, and is therefore datable to 255 BC +-1. Asoka's coronation therefore is 268 BC.},

Also several noble and vice-regal families from Delhi were living there. Prinsep says (246-7), "Maha Singh and his Sikhs sacked the town [of Jammu] and ravaged the whole territory of Jummoo, and he is reported tohave brought away a large spoil, including much specie and valuables of all kinds.[footnote:] Khooshwaqt Rae states the plunder obtained by Maha Singh, from Jummoo, at two crores of rupees; but this seems much exaggerated. He also states that Brij-Raj had been killed in an action with a Bhangee detachment, and his son, Chyt Singh, was the Raja, when Maha Singh captured and sacked the town."},

His first book, \emph{Purchas His Pilgrimage} (1613), was designed as a survey of peoples and religions of the world. Its success led to his most famous compilation of travel literature, \emph{Hakluytus Posthumus, or Purchas His Pilgrims} (4 vol., 1625) for which he used the papers of Richard Hakluyt, East India Company records, and many manuscripts he had collected, which have since been lost. See selections by H. G. Rawlinson (1931) and C. Wild (1939).\par Samuel Purchas, the greatest compiler of English seafaring literature, never travelled more than 200 miles from his birth- place but he played a pivotal role in the literary history of Canada and British Columbia.\\ Born in Essex (exact date unknown), Purchas (pronounced Pur-kas) was ordained in 1578. He served as chaplain to the Archbishop of Canterbury and later became the rector of St. Martin's Church in London.\\ His first important publication was a translation of Jacques Cartier's travel memoir, Cartier's Short and Briefe Narration (1580), followed by Divers Voyages, dedicated to Sir Philip Sidney, and Discourse on the Western Planting (1584) for Walter Raleigh. He presented Queen Elizabeth with an analysis of Aristotle's Politics and he completed a translation of Laudonniṇre's travels to Florida in 1587.\\ Purchas later published his first major book, an attempt to survey the peoples and religions of the world. It has an unwieldy title provided on the next page.\\ Purchas then used the papers of Richard Hakluyt and East India Company records, plus many manuscripts he had gathered during his lifetime, to produce his famous omnibus about travel literature.

This is part of Kuppuswami Sastri's article, \cite{kupp-rama}.\\ Śāhaji, son of Māloji, succeeded his father's mansab under Nizamshah of Ahmednagar in 1619, and died 1664.\\ In the SV sarga 1, vv.47--54, Ekoji prays to Śiva for children. Śiva says in a dream that he must marry Dīpā of the Iṅgila family, and that Śiva will be incarnated in his sons to fight the yavanas: \emph{dharā purāsau yavanair udagrair upaplutiṃ gacchati durnivārām/\\ mahīpate tatra mayāvatāraḥ kāryo nikāryo vasudhāvasādaḥ// 50//}.\\ Sarga 2 of the SV describes Śāhaji's birth and childhood. 2.34, Ekoji goes on a military campaign from Bangalore [in 1674]. 3.28--38: description of Tanjore and its mansions etc. 6.37--38: Poets and scholars engage the King's attention with their compositions and learned discussions: \emph{pragalbha-saurabhya dhurandharābhir marandamādhuryamanoharābhiḥ/\\ abhūṣayan vāgbhir amuṃ kavīndrāḥ prasūnamālābhir ivojjvalābhiḥ// 37//\\ phaṇyagragaṇyaprabhṛtiprabandha- pragalbha-tātparya-vivecanādīn/ prasañjayanti sma vaconigumbhān prabhor abhijñasya budhās samīpe// 38//} 6.40--44: description of Tryambaka Makhin.

He says that, for the first time, the Madura forces which have subdued the Setupati, have imposed ferry fees for pilgrims at the holy Setu (verse 53); represents that the Setupati seeks Śāhaji's help against Madura.\\ 7.1--4: Śāhaji holds consultation with his minister; the latter says that beside the troubles which the Setupati (Raghnunātha-kilavan of Ramnad) is in, Rājārām (Śivāji's son staying in Gingee Fort) is being harrassed by the command (Zulfikar Khan) of the Moghul King (Aurangzeb); he wants to know whether they should first go to the rescue of Rājārām or of the Setupati. \\ Setupati first. Never seems to get to Rājārām, but later hears news that he is okay (verse 8.61--65).},

Cat. XIV, pp.6410--12, the \emph{Avaidikadarśanasaṅgraha} of Gaṅgādhara Vājapeyin is very important in that it shows the friendship between the author and Bhāskararāya, and also the relation that the two had with the king Śāhaji. The MS was copied by Bhāskararāya, and he eulogises the king in 8 verses.\par Similarly, MS 7685 of the \emph{Ātmavidyāvilāsa} by Sadāśiva Brahmendra has a colophon which is a covering letter by Malhāri Paṇḍita, a courtier of young Serfoji I, sent to the prince along with the MS. Malhāri has gone on a trip to perform vows at holy places for Serfoji to have a child. At Dīpāmbapuram, Malhāri met Sadāśiva and propitiated him, and the latter blessed Serfoji through the gift of a copy of his \emph{Ātmavidyāvilāsa}. Serfoji was soon blessed with a child.\par From verses in the \emph{Ācāranavanīta} of Appādhvarin we learn that Śāhaji, at the conclusion of Tryambakarāya's sacrifice, brought the author Appa to court and listended to his exposition of the Mahābhārata day and night for three months. At the end the king asked Appa to compile the \emph{Ācāranavanīta}. See \cite[193]{kupp-rama} and JOR Madras, III, 72--73, V. A. Ramaswami Sastri, `Ānandarāyamakhin versus Appādhvarin'. p.20: Ḍhuṇḍhirāja was the king's paurāṇika: MS 10957: \emph{iti śāhamahārājapaurāṇika-Ḍhuṇḍhivyāsa viracitaṃ śāhavilāsagītaṃ vijayatām} pp.20--21: several scholars commissioned to write a work jointly. \begin{itemize*} \item śrīdhara Veṅkaṭeśa (a. of Sahendravilasa) was commissioned with another Veṅkaṭeśa Śāstrin and Nallāśāstrin to prepare the compilation of words \emph{Padamaṇimañjarī}. MSS 5011, 5012. \item the philosophical \emph{Ṣaḍdarśanīsiddhāntasaṅgraha} was prepared by seven scholars including Rāmabhadra Dīkṣita.

Based on the example of India during the first century of British colonial conquest, it examines the specificities of intercultural encounter in the subcontinent, the formalized institutions that were engendered, and the kinds of knowledge practices that emerged in the case of the geographical survey of India. The essay suggests that the knowledge created in this context is not just local in character, but participates wholly in the emergence of universal science, as well as of other institutions of modernity.},

  abstract         = {Founded in 1690 as an entrepôt by the English East India Company, Calcutta has been at the intersection of a number of heterogeneous long- and short-range networks of trade, finance, diplomacy, law, crafts and learning. This article explores the history of the first century of its existence during which it grew from insignificance to become the second most important city of the British Empire. During this period Calcutta also emerged as a world-city of scientific knowledge making in botany, geology, geodesy, map-making, geography, history, linguistics and ethnology. Calcutta thus provides an excellent case study of the co-construction of knowledge and urbanity in the early modern context of globalisation. As a contact zone between different ethnic, professional and religious communities, each with their specific knowledge practices, this article shows that new forms of knowledge, many at the heart of the second scientific revolution, were produced in this city through attempts at recognising and managing difference in this cosmopolitan context.},

  abstract         = {Tantrasaṅgraha, composed by the renowned Kerala astronomer Nīlakaṇtha Somayaji (c. 1444–1545 CE) ranks along with Āryabhatīya of Āryabhata and Siddhāntaśiromani of Bhāskarācārya as one of the major works that significantly influenced further work on astronomy in India. One of the distinguishing features of this text is the introduction of a major revision of the traditional planetary models which includes a unified theory of planetary latitudes and a better formulation of the equation of centre for the interior planets (Mercury and Venus) than was previously available.

Several important innovations in mathematical technique are also to be found in Tantrasaṅgraha, especially related to the computation of accurate sine tables, the use of series for evaluating the sine and cosine functions, and a systematic treatment of the problems related to the diurnal motion of the celestial objects. The spherical trigonometry relations presented in the text—applied to a variety of problems such as the computation eclipses, elevation of the moon’s cusps and so forth—are also exact.

In preparing the translation and explanatory notes, the authors have used authentic Sanskrit editions of Tantrasaṅgraha by Suranad Kunjan Pillai and K V Sarma. The text consists of eight chapters—mean londitudes, true longitues, gnomonic shadow, lunar eclipse, solar eclipse, vyatīpāta, reduction to observation and elevation of the moon’s cusps—and 432 verses. All the verses have been translated into English and are supplemented with detailed explanations including all mathematical relations, figures and tables using modern mathematical notation.
This edition of Tantrasaṅgraha will appeal to historians of astronomy as well as those who are keen to know about the actual computational procedures employed in Indian astronomy. It is a self-contained text with several appendices included, enabling the reader to comprehend the subject matter without the need for further research.},

A sustained meditation on a lost place from a lost time, this elegantly written book is the first to explore Lemuria's incarnations across cultures, from Victorian-era science to Euro-American occultism to colonial and postcolonial India. The Lost Land of Lemuria widens into a provocative exploration of the poetics and politics of loss to consider how this sentiment manifests itself in a fascination with vanished homelands, hidden civilizations, and forgotten peoples. More than a consideration of nostalgia, it shows how ideas once entertained but later discarded in the metropole can travel to the periphery - and can be appropriated by those seeking to construct a meaningful world within the disenchantment of modernity. Sumathi Ramaswamy ultimately reveals how loss itself has become a condition of modernity, compelling us to rethink the politics of imagination and creativity in our day.},

  abstract         = {“Lives of great men all remind us, We can make our lives sublime; And departing leave behind us,
Footprints on the sands of time.” -H.W.Longfellow. The earliest replantations were done by Lord Shiva by attaching an
elephant’s head on his son’s body and by Ashwini Kumars who successfully replanted the severed head of Yagna.
Thus the history of plastic surgery in India dates as far back or before the Vedic times nearly 4000 years ago. Brahma,
the creator of the universe evolved, Ayurveda (the science of life) by meditation and imparted it to Daksha Prajapati,
who in turn taught the Ashwini Kumars (twin gods). Lord Indra, the celestial ruler, learnt it from Ashwini Kumars and
in turn passed on the knowledge to many rishis, namely, Sage Bharadwaja (Guru of Atreya), and King Divadaasa of
Banaras (Lord Dhanvantri). Sushruta, who was Vishwamitra’s son, along with others approached Dhanvantri and
requested him to accept them as his “shishyas” and teach them the science of Ayurveda. Sushruta Samhita is
believed to be part of one of the four Vedas (part of Atharva-veda) and was written by Sushruta in
approximately 600 BC compiling what he had learnt from his Guru Dhanwantri and his predecessors.
It is said that Sushruta taught surgery at the Banaras University.[2] He has very succinctly described
the reconstruction of the nose by cheek flap, repair of cut earlobe, piercing of earlobe, repair of cut lip,
skin grafting, classification of burns, wound care and wound healing. Sushruta has been rightly called the “Father of Plastic Surgery” and “Hippocrates” of the 6th or 7th century BC. He described rhinoplasty for a cut nose as follows: [1],[2] 1) The leaf of a creeper, long and broad enough to fully cover the whole of the severed or clipped off part, should be gathered, 2) A patch of living flesh, equal in dimension to the preceding leaf should be sliced off from the region of the cheek. 3) After scarifying the severed nose with a knife, the flesh is swiftly adhered to it. 4) Insert two small pipes in the nostrils to facilitate respiration and to prevent flesh from hanging down. 5) The adhesioned part is dusted with the powders of Pattanga, Yashtimadhukam and Rasanjana pulverized together. 6) The nose should be enveloped in Karpasa cotton and several times sprinkled over with the refined oil of pure sesamum. 7) When the healing is complete and parts have united, remove the excess skin.” Even in those days he had emphasised the accurate cutting of the pattern to the size of the defect, the accurate cutting and suturing of the flap to the nose and maintaince of airway with tubes.[3] Frank McDowell has very aptly described Sushruta in the book “The source book of plastic surgery”[2] as follows: “Through all of Sushruta’s flowery language, incantations and irrelevancies, there shines the unmistakable picture of a great surgeon. Undaunted by his failures, unimpressed by his successes, he sought the truth unceasingly and passed it on to those who followed. He attacked disease and deformity definitively, with reasoned and logical methods. When the path did not exist, he made one.”[2] There was a second method of rhinoplasty in India as practiced by Tilemakers. This involved using a free graft from the buttock. The skin and the underlying tissue of the shape of the defect on the nose was beaten with wooden slippers and applied on the defect with some “cement”.[4] In the 4th century, another scholar named Vaghbat wrote Ashtanga Sangraha and Ashtanga Hridyans. In Ashtanga Hridyans, he described rhinoplasty as done by Maharishi Atreya and emphasized the need for the provision of an inner lining by turning down the nasal skin.[3] The classical cheek flap rhinoplasty of Sushruta and Vaghbat was later modified by using a rotation flap from the adjacent forehead, The Traditional Indian Method of Rhinoplasty. This was kept a secret for centuries in India, and practiced by Marattas of Kumar near Poona, certain Nepaly families and Kanghairas of Kangra (Himachal Pradesh). [5] Dr. S. C. Almast personally met the last Hakim of Kangra, Mr. Dinanath Kanghaira whose family was practicing the art of rhinoplasty since the war of Kurukshetra and at Kangra since 1440 AD. Those with cut noses and deformed noses due to leprosy and syphilis were operated by them. The patient was given wine to drink to put him to sleep (since anesthesia did not exist in those days). A pattern of the defect was made on a paper. A handkerchief was tied around the neck to make the veins of the forehead prominent, and the flap was marked including the vein on the forehead (in the pedicle between the eyebrows). The forehead flap was folded in itself to form the inner lining. The knowledge of rhinoplasty spread from India to Arabia and Persia and from there to Egypt and Italy in the 15th century. The first translation of Sushruta Samhita was in Latin by Hessler in 1844 and in Arabic by Ibn Abi Usaybia (1203-1269 AD) and later into German by Vellurs. Bhishagratna translated it in English in 1907.[2] Although Britishers lived in India for a long time, they were not aware of Indian Rhinoplasty till 1793. Mr. James Findlay and Mr. Thomas Crusoe who were surgeons at the British Residency in Poona in 1793 witnessed the operation on “Cowasjee” and reported the details of the operation in the Madras Gazette. The same operation on Cowasjee was later published in Gentleman’s magazine, London, Oct. 1794 by a letter from Mr. Lucas[2] as follows: “Cowasjee, a Mahratta of the caste of the husbandmen, he was a bullock driver with the English Army in the war of 1792, and was made prisoner by Tipu Sultan, who cut off his nose and one of his hands. He joined the Bombay Army near Seringapatam. For about 1 year he remained without a nose, when he had a new one put on by a man of the Brickmaker (potter’s) caste near Poona”. Towards the end of the 19th century, two important works were published in India. One was titled “Rhinoplasty” by Tribhovandas Motichand Shah in 1889, who was then the Chief Medical Officer of Junagadh.[6] He described over a hundred cases treated by him in 4 years and gave minute operative details and discussed the advantages of forehead rhinoplasty. He used paper to make a pattern and used anesthesia. (Till now there was no mention of anaesthesia. Patients were just given wine to drink before surgery.) His name became a legend and it was said that “Kalu cuts the nose and Tribhovan reconstructs it”. Kalu was a local dacoit of that time who used to cut off people’s noses. The other book was “Rhinoplasty operations, with a description of recent improvements in the Indian method” by Keegan in 1900.[7] Even today, the western world gives credit to India for rhinoplasty called as the Indian Rhinoplasty. This of course, later received a few modifications, but the basic principles as laid down by Sushruta remain the same. Plastic Surgery in modem India owes a great deal to Sir Harold Gillies, Eric Peet and B.K. Rank for developing this speciality. In 1945, two Indian maxillofacial surgical units were established. No.l unit at Kirkee under Fitzgibbon and later under Gibson. No. 2 unit was at Secunderabad under Eric Peet. In 1946, Dr. C. Balakrishnan was posted at the No. 1 unit. The two units later merged to form a maxillofacial center for the Indian Army at Bangalore. In 1950, the first two Plastic Surgery departments were established in India. One at Patna under Dr. R. N. Sinha and the other at Nagpur under Dr. C. Balakrishnan. Sir Harold Gillies paid a visit to India and he was pleased with the work being done by Indian surgeons, especially Major Sukh, at the Armed Forces Medical College, Pune.[8] In 1955, the Govt. of India invited Mr. B. K. Rank, from Australia, to advise on the development of Plastic Surgery in India. He welcomed the idea of forming a plastic surgery section of Association of Surgeons of India. In 1957 Sir Harold Gillies visited India again. During his visit to Pune, he demonstrated various operations and techniques. He visited and lectured at several centres in various parts of the country, namely, Calcutta, Delhi, Patna, Jaipur and lastly Nagpur where he formally inaugurated the Plastic Surgery section of Association of Surgeons of India. The members were Dr. R. N. Cooper, Dr. C. Balakrishnan, Dr. M. Mukerjee, Dr. R. N. Sharma, Dr. N. H. Antia, and Dr. Hiveda.[8] The late Dr. C. Balkrishnan, was a devoted and dynamic plastic surgeon. He succeeded in establishing the first Department of Plastic and Maxillofacial surgery at the Govt. Medical College and Hospital, Nagpur. M. S. degree in Plastic Surgery was started in 1960, for the first time in India. Dr. Balkrishnan described Z-plasty for the nasal lining in cleft palate, classification of cleft lip and palate called as the “Nagpur Classification” and skin grafting in total avulsion of testes. In the same year, another department of Plastic Surgery was established at Patna under Dr. R. N. Sinha. Later, two more departments were started at Calcutta under Dr. M. Mukerjee and at Lucknow under Dr. R. N. Sharma. Dr. Antia, the 3rd generation trained Plastic Surgeon under Sir Harold Gillies worked at the Leprosy home in Khandala (near Pune) in 1958. He was the first surgeon to succeed in the integration of leprosy in general hospital practice. The unit at Sir. J. J. Hospital, Mumbai, was started in 1959 under Dr. N. H. Antia. In 1964, Tata Trusts provided a substantial grant to carry out two projects - one on Leprosy and other on Burns. The world’s first microvascular surgery on humans, a free flap transfer using microvascular anastomosis was done in 1966 by Dr. Antia and Dr. Buch (Scandinavian journal of Plastic surgery 1977). In 1961, another plastic surgery unit in Mumbai was established at K. E. M. Hospital, under Dr. Charles Pinto. Eric Peet from Oxford was a regular visitor to this department for the first 3 months. Dr. Pinto advocated one stage repair of cleft lip and palate, called as the “Hole-in-one” procedure. In 1964 one more department was started in Mumbai at G. T. Hospital, under Dr. R. J. Manekshaw. In 1963, Safdarjung Hospital, Delhi started a department of Burns, Plastic and maxillofacial surgery, with Dr. J. L. Gupta, as its head. Gradually, multiple centers in Plastic Surgery were established all over the country and various associations were formed. In 1971, Burns Association of India was formed during the 1st Congress of Burns at the J. J. Hospital. Dr. M. H. Keswani was the Secretary. Later under his leadership, the Burns Association flourished with contributions like potato peel dressings, prevention campaigns by way of radio and TV talks, small documentary ads, etc. “Pour water on Bums” has received worldwide popularity. In 1974, Indian society of surgery of the hand was formed with Dr. Ashok Sen Gupta as the president. A hand surgery unit was started at the Stanley Medical College at Madras under Dr. R. Venkataswami. Today it is one of the biggest and best hand surgery units in the world. Indian Society for Reconstructive Microsurgery was also formed at Madras in 1992 with Dr. R. Venkataswamy as the president. The contributions made by various Plastic Surgeons in India are numerous by way of devising new instruments, research and publications (papers and books). To mention all is beyond the scope of this paper. Today every state in India has multiple plastic surgery training centres. Each centre trains a number of postgraduate students every year who have spread all over India and abroad serving the community to their fullest. The specialty continues to grow and advance in all the fields of Plastic Surgery. :: References Top 1.Sushruta Samhita.

  annotation       = {Nāyaka period = roughly 1500--1730 (fall of Madurai) Three major Nāyaka states: Senji, Tanjavur, Madurai/Tiruccirappalli. p.\,x: ``\ldots most general histories of India written in the last two decades do not even \emph{mention} the Nāyakas, treating the period from 1565 (the defeat of Vijayanagara at the hads of the Deccan Sultanates) to 1761 (the rise of Haidar Ali in Mysore) as something akin to a black hole in south Indian history." Cites the works of Susan Bayly, Carol Appadurai Breckenridge, Nicholas Dirks, Noboru Karashima, David Ludden, George Michell, R. Nagaswamy, Pamela Price, Burton Stein, Joanne Waghorne, Paul Younger. p.\,x: ``Nāyaka south India has been largely ignored, its cultural universe devalued and disdained, until very recent times. One of the major reasons for this is surely that the immense wealth of sources from this period remains to a very large extent unexplored. This is partly a question of the heavy linguistic demands made by the materials---in Tamil, Telugu, Sanskrit, Portuguese, Dutch and Italian---but it also stems from deeper methodological roots. Still regnant prejudices ensure that some of the richest sources are treated as somehow illegitimate: for if inscriptions and travel accounts continue to provide the historian's staple fare, literary materials are often regarded with considerable suspicion." p.\,314: Take the instance of Tanjavur. As we have noted earlier, the three Nāyaka kingdoms had differing political fates: while Senji passed to the control of Bijapur by 1650, Madurai remained nominally autonomous until as late as the 1730s. The case of Tanjavur is the median one, for after a brief interregnum in 1673--5 (when it was ruled over by a Madurai-nominated Nāyaka), it passed by the mid 1670s to the definitive control of a section of the Marāṭha Bhonsle clan, who ruled it until 1855, when the British resumed it under the Doctrine of Lapse. p.337 (Sources for Nāyaka history): In Sanskrit there is a pronounced tendency towards satirical works of this scale: the great Nīlakaṇṭha Dīkṣita in seventeenth century Madurai composed a portrait of his age, the mordant \emph{Kaliviḍambana}, \marginpar{NCC: Nīlakaṇṭha Dīkṣita, son of Nārāyaṇa Dīkṣita, and grandson of Āccān Dīkṣita (brother of Appayya Dīkṣita). Kalivi. was published Trivandrum 1886, Brit. Mus. Ptd. Bks. 1876--92, 262} as well as a work of cryptic and sardonic \emph{anyāpadeśa} verses. From outside the court, we have the roughly contemporaneous Veṅkaṭādhvarin's \emph{Viśvaguṇādarśacampū}, one of a series of imaginative `travelogues' offering detailed descriptions---again, partly ironic and satirical---of southern India. p.338:\ldots Cesare Frederici and Gasparo Balbi (1560s and 1580s), the Fleming Jaques de Coutre, and the Icelander J\'on \'Olafsson, which are available in published editions, and in some instances even in translation.},

  abstract             = {Ayurveda, the classical South Asian medical tradition, was first introduced to American audiences in the mid-1980s as a holistic alternative to biomedical orthodoxy. This article argues that transplanted Ayurveda is shaped not only by aspects of American medical culture, but by millennial, heterodox elements of American religious culture, such as the loose cluster of beliefs and practices known as the New Age. Because New Age Ayurvedic practices occupy the ideological and statutory middle ground between medicine and metaphysics, they face a unique professionalizing dilemma: whether to present themselves as healing religions or as practicing branches of medicine. Drawing on an ethnographic study of this professionalizing dilemma in legal, clinical and popular arenas, this article shows that New Age Ayurveda-far from being a monolith-reveals a wide-ranging plurality of sub-traditions in practice. Taken together, they suggest multiple modes of reinvention and a variety of professionalizing routes that Ayurveda follows other than licensing and institutional credentialization.},

  abstract         = {The stethoscope, and its use in the medical examination, has become iconic of ‘doctors’ and their work. Drawing on fieldwork in a London hospital, this article explores why this is so. It argues that the application of this instrument in a clinical situation allows for a particularly neat enactment of key ‘dispositions’ of what might be described as a doctor ‘habitus’ (Bourdieu, The Logic of Practice, 1980). Examining the politics of stethoscope ownership and display, the article also reveals some of the capacities or types of ‘agency’ doctors assign to the instrument that they exploit in the day-to-day production and performance of their medical identity (Gell, Art and Agency in Anthropological Theory, 1998). At a time when new diagnostic technologies threaten to render the stethoscope obsolete, doctors are shown to want to retain the instrument as a symbol of the skill and knowledge they possess, but which they believe to be increasingly devalued and undermined in modern medicine.},

At the period when he furnished the evidence I am referring to, viz. in 1837. he gave the committee the following interesting account of himself, which, together with his evidence, I condense somewhat from his answers.\par "I have practiced medicine in Calcutta for twelve years among the native population. I was educated in the Sanscrit and English College for six years, where I afterwards became professor of Sanscrit medicine. Before I entered the college, I had been taught the native system of medicine under Kableeram Kobeeraze, [Kavirāja] a learned native doctor, under whose instructions I also visited patients in the villages. During my studies at the Sanscrit College I attended for five years the lectures of Dr Tytler and Dr Grant upon anatomy and the theory and practice of medicine and surgery. In the two latter years of the period I was their assistant, it being my business to explain to the students (who were all natives) the English terms in Sanscrit and Bengalee. It is now two years since I left the college, and at present I am pundit of the Medical College, where I assist the professors, Drs Goodeve and O'Shaughnessy, in explaining to the students the branches which have formed the subject of their prelections. After lecture is over, I explain the name of the diseases in Bengalee, and the qualities of native medicines according to my experience. As a practitioner of medicine, my experience has been obtained among the respectable, the middle, and the poorer classes of natives; most [p.312] among the middle classes. I have seen a great deal of the diseses of the lower classes in every part of the native town; very little in the suburbs; but I receive every day statements of the diseases and treatment of the natives in the Villages from the native doctors. Moreover, two or three times in a month I go to my native village, Baydaypatty, about sixteen miles from Calcutta, and stay two or three days or a week, and when there I practise among the native inhabitants.\par I visit women as well as men, Hindoo women, few Mussulmen, and still fewer Mussulman women. Mussulmans, however, are attended by Hindu physicians, as well as by those of their own religion; they have no objection to be so. My grandfather was family physician to the Nowab at Hoogley."\par Roberton extracts his information from the \emph{Report of the Committee Appointed by the Right Honourable the Governor of Bengal for the Establishment of a Fever Hospital, and for Inquiring into Local Management and Taxation in Calcutta} \citep{beng-repo}},

  abstract         = {This paper examines the puruṣa concept in the Caraka Saṃhitā, an early text of Ayurveda, and its relation to Indic thinking about phenomenal worldhood. It argues that, contrary to the usual interpretation, early Ayurveda does not consider the person to be a microcosmic replication of the macrocosmos. Instead, early Ayurveda asserts that personhood is worldhood, and thus the person is non-different from the phenomenal totality of his existence. This is confirmed by the CS’s several definitions of puruṣa, which are alternately posed in terms familiar to Vaiśeṣika, early Sāṃkhya, early Buddhism, and Upaniṣadic monism. It is likewise confirmed by the Ayurvedic logic of sāmānya, which governs the meaning of the list of person-to-world correspondences in CS 4.5 and its often misinterpreted claim, puruṣo’yam lokasaṃmitaḥ. Finally it is confirmed in the program of Ayurvedic therapeutics, which aims at establishing various kinds of “appropriateness” for the sake of effecting samayoga—the “harmonious joining” of person and world.},

Biopiracy cases continue to emerge in the media and public eye, yet they remain the source of considerable disagreement, confusion, controversy and grief. The aim of this book is to provide the most detailed, coherent analysis of the issue of biopiracy to date. The book synthesises the rise of the issue and increasing use of the term by activists and negotiators in the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), to form a critical understanding of the themes, implications and politics of biopiracy. Taking a case-study based approach, derived from interviews and fieldwork with researchers, government, industry, local farmers, healers and indigenous people, the author sequentially documents events that have occurred in biopiracy and bioprospecting controversies. Implications and ethical dilemmas are explored, particularly relating to work with local communities, and the power relations entailed. Detailing international debates from the WTO, CBD and other flora in an accessible manner, the book provides a unique overview of current institutional limitations and suggests ways forward. Options and solutions are suggested which are relevant for local communities, national governments, international negotiators, NGO and interest groups, researchers and industry.},

The paper should be read with a companion blog, at http://scholarlydigitaleditions.blogspot.com/2013/07/why-digital-humanists-should-get-out-of.html, which elaborates an alternative model for collaboration between textual scholars and digital humanists (basically: many scholars/many projects/many digital humanists), and advocates too the widespread adoption of Creative Commons attribution share-alike licences (without the toxic 'non-commercial' restriction) for edition materials, and for their availability through open APIs, independent of any one interface. Joris van Zundert's blog at http://brandaen.huygensinstituut.nl/?p=497 (note his comment on his own blog) also contains arguments which should be read alongside this paper.},

Leonard Bloomfield's synchronic grammatical works were heavily nfluenced by the sixth century B.C. Indian grammarian Panini. Word for-mation, compounds, suppletion, zero, form-classes, and generality and specificity in Bloomfield's Language, Eastern Ojibwa, and The Menomini Language are correlated with their counterparts in Panini's grammar of Sanskrit. Selections from a manuscript of Bloomfield's translation and annotation of the Kasika, a traditional Sanskrit work on Panini's gram{3}, provide concrete evidence for the influence of Panini on Bloomfield.},

  abstract         = {Rejuvenation techniques, inspired by a common classical tradition, are described in Caraka (Cikitsā I, 1–4) and in Suśruta (Cikitsā XXVII–XXX), followed up by the Nāvanītaka (Bower Ms., sl.188–200) and by the Astāngahrdayasamhitā (Uttara XXXIX). Valuable mediaeval tīkā comment on the details of these techniques and indeed interesting modern examples of a treatment closely following the ancient medical texts are known.

[Contrary to the cure taking place ‘in the open air and in the sun’ (vātātapika), the practice of rejuvenation characterized by the ku is applied indoors in premises called kutī or āgāra, built according to definite rules (site, architecture, etc.). The patient enters at a time astrologically auspicious, after performing certain rites and preparing his mind for a treatment which is as perilous as it is laborious.

The rites of the operation and the unusual type of abode, difficult to interpret, permit, however, an examination of the textual data in a different light from that of the scholiasts themselves, who remain very guarded, and even obscure, on important points of detail. Here one must presume an initiation ceremony whose method was used for the legendary sages as well as patients of today. The technique which is called ‘retreat in a hut’ implies the idea of regressus ad uterum. Rejuvenation which constitutes, from the biological point of view, a regeneration of the body (kāyakalpa) must be considered on the symbolical plane as a ‘new birth’: the patient is assimilated to the embryo, and to the uterus correspond both the ‘hut’ described in the classical Āyurvedic treatises and the dark enclosed premises recommended by the modern kavirāj.},

  abstract  = {Mainstreaming the ayurveda, yoga, unani, siddha, homeopathy systems should imply deep changes in maternity care. Big changes there are, but in the wrong direction. Aiming to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality, the National Rural Health Mission's Janani Suraksha Yojana scheme presses expectant mothers to go for "institutional delivery" and avoid home births. The NRHM document also speaks of revitalising local health traditions. This means that the dais who have been part of the local health traditions should be incorporated into the government structure at the lowest end as has always been the case. This paper raises various questions related to maternity care governance for the benefit of local communities and looks at the possibilities of strengthening the services with serious inputs from dais. It acknowledges the dimensions of class, caste, gender, power and ideology that would be implicated in the acceptance of the "dai tradition" within the healthcare services system.},

Hence he called together the best cooks and experts in culinary art from his palace cuisine and from abroad who were proficient in South Indian, North Indian, the Mugalai (mussalmani) and European methods of preparations. Excellent recipes in those branches were ordered to be recorded in Marathi and Tamil languages for the benefit of all. Treatise on special European dishes were also translated into Indian languages and they are still preserved in his great library at Tanjore. \par A complete work embodying all the three systems of cullinary art by the name of `Sarabhendra Paka Shastra' seems to have been compiled but unfortunately we have now only an incomplete version of the same. In fact he had ordered one of his scholars Dhonda Bhatta Appa to translate in Marathi an ancient Sanskrit work called ``Bhojana Kutuhala" by one Raghunatha Suri as is seen from the half finished Marathi version available in the Library.},

Can they ever articulate the meanings and logics of non-Western peoples? Who has the right to speak for whom? Questions such as these are debated in this text. Marshall Sahlins addresses these issues head on, while building a case for the ability of anthropologists orking in the Western tradition to nderstand other cultures. In recent years, these questions have arisen in debates over the death and deification of Captain James Cook on Hawaii Island in 1779. Did the Hawaiians truly receive Cook as a manifestation of their own god Lono? Or were they too pragmatic, too worldly-wise to accept the foreigner as a god? Moreover, can a ``non-native" scholar give voice to a ``native" point of view? This volume seeks to go far beyond specialized debates about the alleged superiority of Western traditions. The culmination of Sahlins's ethnohistorical research on Hawaii, is a reaffirmation for understanding difference.},

  abstract  = {This vivid book retells the story of Captain Cook’s great voyages in the South Seas, focusing on the encounters between the explorers and the island peoples they “discovered.” While Cook and his men were initially confounded by the Polynesians, they were also curious. Cook and his crew soon formed friendships—and often more intimate relationships—with the islanders. The islanders, who initially were not certain if the Englishmen were even human, came to experiment with Western customs and in some cases joined the voyagers on their expeditions.

But familiarity quickly bred contempt. Shipboard discipline was threatened by these new relationships, and the culture of the islands was also changed forever. Captain Cook, initially determined to act as an enlightened leader, saw his resolve falter during the third voyage. Amicable relations turned hostile, culminating in Cook’s violent death on the shores of Hawaii.

In this masterful account of Cook’s voyages, Anne Salmond—a preeminent authority on the history of the south seas—reimagines two worlds that collided in the eighteenth century, and the enduring impact of that collision.

Anne Salmond is Distinguished Professor of Maori Studies at the University of Auckland and a Pro-Vice Chancellor of the University. An award-winning author, she was made Dame Commander of the British Empire in 1995 for services to literature and the Maori people.},

  abstract          = {The Arapacana syllabary appears in many Buddhist texts in Sanskrit and other languages in place of the normal Sanskrit varṇamālā. Unlike the standard system, the Arapacana does not follow any apparent phonetic sequence, and is incomplete, lacking several of the simple vowels and consonants. It also includes several conjunct consonants which are not part of the normal system. Several theories have been proposed as to the origin, nature and purpose of this peculiar system. As for the question of the geographical and linguistic origins of the Arapacana, with which this paper is mainly concerned, the most widely held theory has been that of Konow, who thought that the Arapacana was invented in central Asia. A re-examination of this question, however, shows that it must have originally been formulated in the region of Gandhāra (in the modern North West Frontier Province of Pakistan) and in the Gāndhārī (Prakrit) language and Kharoṣṭhī script, as has been suggested by F. W. Thomas and others. This is established on the basis of both epigraphical evidence, in the form of four occurrences (three of them previously unrecognized) of the Arapacana in Kharoṣṭhī documents, and of internal evidence such as the distribution of the characters, particularly the consonant conjuncts, which reflects phonetic and graphic characteristics of an underlying Gāndhārī/Kharoṣṭhī original.},

Summary:Yoga, tantra and other forms of Asian meditation are practised in modernized forms throughout the world today, but most introductions to Hinduism or Buddhism tell only part of the story of how they developed. This book is an interpretation of the history of Indic religions up to around 1200 CE, with particular focus on the development of yogic and tantric traditions. It assesses how much we really know about this period, and asks what sense we can make of the evolution of yogic and tantric practices, which were to become such central and important features of the Indic religious scene. Its originality lies in seeking to understand these traditions in terms of the total social and religious context of South Asian society during this period, including the religious practices of the general population with their close engagement with family, gender, economic life and other pragmatic concerns.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present the SharedCanvas model for describing the layout of culturally important, hand-written objects such as medieval manuscripts, which is intended to be used as a common input format to presentation interfaces. The model is evaluated using two collections from CATCHPlus not consulted during the design phase, each with their own complex requirements, in order to determine if further development is required or if the model is ready for general usage. The model is applied to the new collections, revealing several new areas of concern for user interface production and discovery of the constituent resources. However, the fundamental information modelling aspects of SharedCanvas and the underlying Open Annotation Collaboration ontology are demonstrated to be sufficient to cover the challenging new requirements. The distributed, Linked Open Data approach is validated as an important methodology to seamlessly allow simultaneous interaction with multiple repositories, and at the same time to facilitate both scholarly commentary and crowd-sourcing of the production of transcriptions.},

  abstract         = {Lead, mercury, and arsenic intoxication have been associated with the use of Ayurvedic herbal medicine product (HMPs). OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence and concentration of heavy metals in Ayurvedic HMPs manufactured in South Asia and sold in Boston-area stores and to compare estimated daily metal ingestion with regulatory standards. DESIGN AND SETTING: Systematic search strategy to identify all stores 20 miles or less from Boston City Hall that sold Ayurvedic HMPs from South Asia by searching online Yellow Pages using the categories markets, supermarkets, and convenience stores, and business names containing the word India, Indian cities, and Indian words. An online national directory of Indian grocery stores, a South Asian community business directory, and a newspaper were also searched. We visited each store and purchased all unique Ayurvedic HMPs between April 25 and October 24, 2003. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Concentrations (microg/g) of lead, mercury, and arsenic in each HMP as measured by x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy. Estimates of daily metal ingestion for adults and children estimated using manufacturers' dosage recommendations with comparisons to US Pharmacopeia and US Environmental Protection Agency regulatory standards. RESULTS: A total of 14 (20%) of 70 HMPs (95% confidence interval, 11%-31%) contained heavy metals: lead (n = 13; median concentration, 40 microg/g; range, 5--37,000), mercury (n = 6; median concentration, 20,225 microg/g; range, 28-104,000), and/or arsenic (n = 6; median concentration, 430 microg/g; range, 37-8130). If taken as recommended by the manufacturers, each of these 14 could result in heavy metal intakes above published regulatory standards. CONCLUSIONS: One of 5 Ayurvedic HMPs produced in South Asia and available in Boston South Asian grocery stores contains potentially harmful levels of lead, mercury, and/or arsenic. Users of Ayurvedic medicine may be at risk for heavy metal toxicity, and testing of Ayurvedic HMPs for toxic heavy metals should be mandatory.},

Chapter 7 of Part 10 is ``Modern Discoveries in Ancient Works": see \url{http: //www.kamakoti.org /hindudharma /part10/chap7.htm} \begin{quote} That all learned people in India knew about the earth's revolution is shown by a passage in the Sivotkarsa-Manjari by Nilakantha Diksita who was minister of Tirumala Nayaka. One stanza in this work begins like this : "Bhumir bhramayati" and from it we must also gather that the author's great-uncle, Appayya Diksita, also knew about this truth. What is the content of this verse? Siva is called "Astamurti". Earth, water, air, fire, space, the sun and the moon, the yajamana or sacrificer--they are all the personification (murti) of Isvara. Among them only the yajamana has no bhramana or motion. All the rest have bhramana, says Appayya Diksita. That he has said so is mentioned in the verse in question by his younger brother's grandson, Nilakantha Diksita. We see that air has movement, that fire does not remain still, that water keeps flowing. When we look up into the sky, we notice that the sun and the moon do not remain fixed to their spots. As for space, it is filled with sound and it cannot be still. But the earth apparently stands still. Even so, says Appayya Diksita, it has motion. "It revolves".\footnote{\cite[pt.\,10, ch.\,7]{chan-hind}.} \end{quote}},

The first half of the work (chapters I-VII) deals with Mathematics and the topics covered are: Parikarma (Logistics), Dasaprasna (ten problems), Bhinnaganita (fractions), Trairasika (rule of three), Kuttakara (linear indeterminate equations), Paridhi and Vyasa (infinite series and approximations for the ratio of the circumference and diameter of a circle) and Jyanayana (infinite series and approximations for sines). The second half of the work (Chapters VIII-XV) deals with Mathematical Astronomy and the topics covered are Grahagati (computation of Mean and true; longitudes of planets), Bhagolai (celestial sphere), Pancadasa-prasna (fifteen problems relation to right ascension, declination etc.), Chayaganita (gnomonic determination of place, time and direction), Grahana (eclipses), Vyatipata (when sun and moon have the same declination), Drkkarma (reduction to observation) and Candrasrngonnati (phases of moon). Ganitayuktibhasa purports to present an exposition of the mathematics necessary for computation of planetary motions as set forth in the great treatise tantrasamgraha (c. 1500) of Nilakanatha Somayaji. The demonstrations given in Ganitayuktibhasa have been reproduced in the form of Sanskrit verses by sankara Variyar in his commentaries Kriyakramakari (c.1535) on Lilavati and Yuktidipika on Tantrasamgraha. There is also a Sanskrit work entitled Ganitayuktibhasa which seems to be a later and somewhat rough Sanskrit translation of the Malayalam original. Even thought the importance of Ganitayuktibhasa was brought to the notice of modern scholarship by C.M. Whish in 1835, an edition of the Mathematic part of the text (along with notes in Malayalam) was published only in 1948 by Ramavarma Thampuran and Akhileswara Aiyar. For the first time, a Critical edition of the entire Malayalam text is being brought out along with English Translation and detailed Explanatory Notes as Volume I, II of the present series. Volume III presents a critical edition of the Sanskrit Ganitayuktibhasa.},

  abstract         = {Ganita-yukti-bhasa (Rationales in Mathematical Astronomy) of Jyesthadeva (c.1530) is a seminal text of the Kerala school of astronomy. It is composed in the Malayalam language and presents detailed yuktis or explanations and demonstrations for the results and processes of mathematical astronomy. The text, comprising fifteen chapters, is naturally divided into two parts, mathematics and astronomy, and purports to give an exposition of the techniques and theories employed in the computation of planetary motions as set forth in the great treatise Tantrasangraha (c.1500) of Nilakantha Somayaji. Even though the importance of Ganita-yukti-bhasa was brought to the attention of modern scholarship by C.M Whish in the 1830s, a critical edition of the entire Malayalam text is published here for the first time along with an English translation and detailed explanatory notes.

The mathematics part is divided into seven chapters. The topics covered are Parikarma (logistics), Dasaprasna (ten problems), Bhinnaganita (fractions), Trairasika (rule of three), Kuttakara (linear indeterminate equations), Paridhi and Vyasa (infinite series and approximations for the ratio of the circumference and diameter of a circle) and Jyanayana (infinite series and approximations for sines). A distinguishing feature of the work is that it presents detailed demonstrations of the famous results attributed to Madhava (c.1340-1420), such as infinite series for p, the arc-tangent and the sine functions, and the estimation of correction terms and their use in the generation of faster convergent series. Demonstrations are also presented for some of the classical results of Aryabhata (c.499) on Kuttakara or the process of solution of linear indeterminate equations, of Brahmagupta (c.628) on the diagonals and the area of a cyclic quadrilateral, and of Bhaskara (c.1150) on the surface area and volume of a sphere.

The astronomy part is divided into eight chapters. The topics covered are Grahagati (computation of mean and true longitudes of planets), Bhugola and Bhagola (Earth and celestial spheres), Pancadasa-prasna (fifteen problems relating to ascension, declination, longitude, etc.), Chaya-ganita (determination of time, place, direction, etc., from gnomonic shadow), Grahana (eclipses), Vyatipata (when the sun and moon have the same declination), Darsana-samskara (visibility correction for planets) and Candra-srngonnati (phases of the moon). A distinguishing feature of this work is that it gives a detailed exposition of the revised planetary model proposed by Nilakantha which, for the first time in the history of astronomy, gives the correct formulation of the equation of centre and the latitudinal motion of the interior planets, Mercury and Venus. Another unique feature of Ganita-yukti-bhasa is that it presents systematic derivations of most of the results of spherical astronomy (pertaining to diurnal and shadow problems, parallax, eclipses, and so on) that are discussed in Indian astronomy},

Moreover, almost all Sanskrit mathematical texts contain rules and illustrative problems related to this subject. In the present essay, an attempt is made to study these diverse types of Sanskrit sources in a combined manner and to see what light they throw on the actual state of affairs in lending money on interest. The first part deals with the nature and chronology of the administrative and legal texts and with the rules laid down in these texts on money lending, the fair rate of interest and the maximum extent to which the interest can accumulate. The second part is devoted to the rules of computation relating to loans and interest as formulated in the mathematical texts and to the examples to illustrate the rules, which are provided in the texts and in their commentaries.},

They migrated subsequently to Benares. The cause of this migration is not known, but it was apparently political. Scholars are of the opinion that the migration was due to the `annexation of the remnants of Nizam Shahi's Dominions by Shah Jehan.' " The PS to the Introduction by R. Anantakrishna Shastry, p. [1], says, "Kavīndrāyachārya's [sic] birth-place seems to be Puṣyabhūmi, i.e., a market-town on the banks of the Godāvarī. The catalogues of the Asiatic Society of Bengal (No. 4028) and India Office Library (no. 3947) read it as Puṇyabhūmi i.e., a sacred place. But I am of opinion that Puṣyabhūmi is the correct reading." His Śaṅkarācārya lineage name was Nṛsiṃhāśrama (ibid.) p. 2 The two top pandits in Benares at Kavindras's time were Śivarāmendrasarasvatī and Brahmendrasarasvatī.

  abstract         = {"A groundbreaking study of the lost tradition of Tibetan Zen containing the first translations of key texts from one thousand years ago. Banned in Tibet, forgotten in China, the Tibetan tradition of Zen was almost completely lost to us. According to Tibetan histories, Zen teachers were invited to Tibet from China in the 8th century, at the height of the Tibetan Empire. When doctrinal disagreements developed between Indian and Chinese Buddhists at the Tibetan court, the Tibetan emperor called for a formal debate. When the debate resulted in a decisive win by the Indian side, the Zen teachers were sent back to China, and Zen was gradually forgotten in Tibet. This picture changed at the beginning of the 20th century with the discovery in Dunhuang (in Chinese Central Asia) of a sealed cave full of manuscripts in various languages dating from the first millennium CE. The Tibetan manuscripts, dating from the 9th and 10th centuries, are the earliest surviving examples of Tibetan Buddhism. Among them are around 40 manuscripts containing original Tibetan Zen teachings. This book translates the key texts of Tibetan Zen preserved in Dunhuang. The book is divided into ten sections, each containing a translation of a Zen text illuminating a different aspect of the tradition, with brief introductions discussing the roles of ritual, debate, lineage, and meditation in the early Zen tradition. Van Schaik not only presents the texts but also explains how they were embedded in actual practices by those who used them"--},

Professional training, the role of the teacher and of foreign languages are dealt with, and the impact of the peculiar features of Indian education on Indian society.\\ pp.119ff. debates and debating recorded in ancient literature},

This puzzle is complicated by the fact that in early Vedic the ásuras do not have the demonic role they play in later Vedic and in fact are themselves sometimes identified as devás. Numerous solutions to this problem have been advanced. This article re-examines the evidence in detail and suggests a new explanation, set in the larger Near Eastern cultural context.},

This new phase was triggered by the formation of Chinese maritime networks to southern Asia. While the Song period witnessed the formation of private trade and shipping networks, the aggressive foreign policy of the Yuan court led to the establishment of a government maritime network. The maritime networking to southern Asia culminated in the increased numbers of Ming emissaries, including the fleets of the admiral Zheng He, who visited Indian ports in the fifteenth century and intervened in the diplomatic affairs of several strategic Indian commercial zones.},

  comment     = {The historiography of colonial science and medicine has expanded remarkably over the last few decades, with India, for understandable reasons, playing a stellar role in this literature. The long, complex history of British rule in the subcontinent offers a vast range of topics crying out for investigation by historians of science and medicine, and while many of these have been studied in great detail from different perspectives, a lot remains virtually untouched. Homoeopathy, for instance, has been enormously popular in various parts of India, but until this pioneering study by Shinjini Das, Vernacular Medicine in Colonial India: Family, Market and Homoeopathy, its history had been almost entirely overlooked by scholars.

Homoeopathy established itself quite securely in nineteenth-century India, as Das shows, without any state support and despite doubts among mainstream medical practitioners about its effectiveness and scientific basis. Focusing on Bengal, where homoeopathy has long been popular, she shows how, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the lack of support from the colonial state was not a problem. With indigenist and nationalist ideas gaining traction among the middle classes, supporters of homoeopathy positioned it as the ideal system of medicine for the indigenous masses because it was inexpensive, was noninvasive, and rarely produced toxic effects. Also, homoeopathy’s symptom-based approach to treatment could be mastered from books (unlike Ayurveda, which could only be learned through a long apprenticeship), and the lack of state regulation allowed ordinary laypeople to become homoeopaths purely through self-education. As Das shows in an instructive chapter, a number of entrepreneurs set up very successful businesses that published homoeopathic manuals, sold medicine kits, and through several journals encouraged the practice of homoeopathic medicine by the laity. The growing market of autodidacts in nineteenth-century Bengal, who purchased teach-yourself manuals on all kinds of subjects, embraced homoeopathy with fervor; countless families would acquire their own medicine chests, convinced of the health-restoring powers of the little round globules soaked in exotically named tinctures.

Although all the medicines they dealt in were imported from the United States or Europe, the homoeopathic firms of Bengal projected themselves as worthy exemplars of the new nationalist spirit by emphasizing their indigenous ownership, their administrative structure (modeled on the Hindu joint family, although not as far as profit sharing was concerned), and their client base, which was not only Bengali but extended far into the rural hinterlands that were poorly served by state-educated allopathic doctors. These strategies were complemented by the intriguing notion that the supposedly German science of homoeopathy was, in fact, Hindu. The founding principle of homoeopathy—that an agent that caused particular symptoms in healthy individuals would also cure them in the diseased—had, it was claimed, first been enunciated in ancient Sanskrit texts. The German savant Samuel Hahnemann had rediscovered a truth known to the Hindu sages and developed it into a modern, scientifically persuasive system, while the authentically Hindu Ayurveda, in neglecting research for countless centuries, had become obsolete. It was the outwardly German homoeopathy that represented the true fulfillment of ancient Hindu wisdom.

One would expect the allopathic doctors of Bengal to have united in opposing homoeopathy. Many of them were, of course, critical of the scientific basis of homoeopathy and dismayed by the absence of systematic training and regulation in the sector. But not all practitioners of Western medicine rejected homoeopathy. Famously, Mahendralal Sircar (1833–1904), who held an MD from the leading medical school of the time, who founded the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, and who was one of the most successful medical practitioners of Calcutta, switched his allegiance to homoeopathy at the height of his career because he found it more in accord with the principles of science. The support of a man of his stature obviously undermined opposition to homoeopathy, and over the years, it would not be unusual to find either Bengali doctors practicing both systems of medicine without any qualms or, indeed, patients who consulted homoeopaths as well as allopaths in different circumstances.

The British rulers, despite worrying about fraudulent homoeopaths and trying occasionally to regulate the profession, could not quite control its growth or public acceptance, and the situation changed only after independence. The state and its agencies were now keen to encourage non-Western systems of medicine, and by lumping homoeopathy with Ayurveda and Unani, it introduced more opportunities for systematic training and registration in these fields. Many homoeopaths, concerned at the proliferation of practitioners of dubious merit, had also been calling for such reforms, but as training became more systematized, it drew increasingly closer to mainstream science, narrowing the gulf between allopaths and homoeopaths that the entrepreneurial firms and practitioners had exploited so creatively.

Drawing upon a vast range of Bengali homoeopathic publications, Vernacular Medicine in Colonial India reconstructs the fascinating history of a medical system that, despite being as alien to India as standard Western medicine, was domesticated relatively quickly by a historically contingent and mutually reinforcing combination of “native” commercial initiative, indigenist reinscription, nationalistic resistance to the colonial state, and autodidactic enthusiasm that was further reinforced by popular misgivings about the cost, invasiveness, and patchy availability of allopathic medicine. A stimulating study of an important but hitherto ignored facet of South Asia’s fabled medical pluralism, this is not only a major contribution to the historiography of medicine but an illuminating intervention in the long-running but often repetitious debate on the unpredictable ways and transmuted versions in which Indian modernities assimilated Western ideas and practices.},

  abstract         = {This paper assesses archaeology’s contribution to debates regarding the ecological focus of early Buddhism and Hinduism and its relevance to global environmentalism. Evidence for long-term human:non-human entanglement, and the socio-economically constructed element of ‘nature’ on which Indic culture supposedly rests, challenges post-colonial tropes of India’s utopian, ‘eco-friendly’ past, whilst also highlighting the potency of individual human:non-human epistemologies for building historically grounded models of Indian environmentalism. For early Buddhism, I mediate between two polarized views: one promoting the idea of ‘eco-dharma’ as a reflection of Buddhism’s alignment with non-violence (ahiṃsā), and the alleviation of suffering (dukkha); a second arguing that early Buddhist traditions have been misappropriated by western environmentalism. I argue that the latter view subscribes to canonical models of passive monks removed from worldly concerns, despite archaeological evidence for socially-engaged monastic landlordism from the late centuries bc. Others cite this evidence only to negate Buddhism’s eco-credentials, thereby overlooking the human:non-human entanglement theme within modern environmental discourse, while the predominant focus on non-human suffering overlooks convergences between modern and ancient ecological ethics and environmental health. Case studies include examples of Buddhist land and water management in central India, set within discussions of human v. non-human-centric frameworks of well-being and suffering, purity and pollution, and broader Indic medico-ecological epistemologies, as possible models for collective responses to environmental stress.},

He depicted society as having a centre-periphery structure, where actors close to the centre of society were more integrated, for instance in the sense that they carried or expressed its main (``core") values, ideas and beliefs. On the other hand, he assumed that those who belonged to the periphery to less extent subscribed to, accepted or promoted such values, ideas and beliefs. He also outlined various processes of dissemination or diffusion from the centre, but also various forms of tensions between the centre and periphery. Later Johan Galtung (1964, reprinted 1974) pursued similar ideas in his work on opinions on foreign policy as a function of social position. He both contrasted the assumed typical cognitive and ideological style of those belonging to entre and periphery respectively (gradualism vs. absolutism/fundamentalism, reformism vs. radicalism/revolutionary, etc.), and developed an index of social position. Galtung eventually generalised the centre-periphery model in his work on imperialism, introducing the subdistinctions between the centre and periphery of the centre and the centre and periphery of the periphery, etc. Another follow-up can be found in Stein Rokkan�s ambitious comparative analysis of political systems (Rokkan 1999: 108--121)."

    •    The individual was from a population that is the largest source of ancestry for South Asians
    •    Iranian-related ancestry in South Asia split from Iranian plateau lineages >12,000 years ago
    •    First farmers of the Fertile Crescent contributed little to no ancestry to later South Asians

Summary

We report an ancient genome from the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC). The individual we sequenced fits as a mixture of people related to ancient Iranians (the largest component) and Southeast Asian hunter-gatherers, a unique profile that matches ancient DNA from 11 genetic outliers from sites in Iran and Turkmenistan in cultural communication with the IVC. These individuals had little if any Steppe pastoralist-derived ancestry, showing that it was not ubiquitous in northwest South Asia during the IVC as it is today. The Iranian-related ancestry in the IVC derives from a lineage leading to early Iranian farmers, herders, and hunter-gatherers before their ancestors separated, contradicting the hypothesis that the shared ancestry between early Iranians and South Asians reflects a large-scale spread of western Iranian farmers east. Instead, sampled ancient genomes from the Iranian plateau and IVC descend from different groups of hunter-gatherers who began farming without being connected by substantial movement of people.},

This paper will contribute to this discussion by reviewing the literature to suggest a crowdsourcing process framework explore the range of decisions that must be addressed in advance to ensure quality and successful project outcomes. In addition, it will report on interviews with several crowdsourcing projects with regards to their workflow organization. The paper will conclude with recommendations for projects contemplating this tool as a way to reach project outcomes with limited project funds.},

These texts belong to the rasaśāstra genre that were translated from Sanskrit into Tibetan by Orgyenpa Rinchenpel (O rgyan pa Rin chen dpal, 1229/30–1309) and integrated into the Tibetan Buddhist Canon of the Tengyur (Bstan ’gyur). The treatises deal with the processing of mercury, which is indispensable to convert metals into gold (gser ’gyur) and to accomplish the ‘mercurial elixir’ (dngul chu’i bcud len). The texts start with the description of a ‘pink-coloured’ (dmar skya mdog) compound, which is described as the amalgam of ‘moonlight-exposed tin’ (gsha’ tshe zla ba phyogs), gold, and copper. According to the texts, mercury has to be ‘amalgamated’ (sbyor ba) with ‘minerals that devour its poisons’ (za byed khams) and with ‘eight metals that bind it’ (’ching khams brgyad); at the same time, mercury is cooked with ‘red substances’ (dmar sde tshan) and other herbal extracts, types of urine and salts, and reduced to ashes. Starting with an outline of the earliest Tibetan medical sources on mercury, I analyse the two treatises with regard to their entire materia alchemica and the respective purification methods aimed at ‘obtaining essences’ (snying stobs), which are then to be absorbed by mercury. I argue that the two thirteenth-century treatises were particularly significant in the process of consolidating pharmaceutical practices based on mercury and the merging of alchemical and medical knowledge in Tibet.},

  abstract = {Urbanism in the Bronze-age Indus Civilisation (~4.6–3.9 thousand years before the present, ka) has been linked to water resources provided by large Himalayan river systems, although the largest concentrations of urban-scale Indus settlements are located far from extant Himalayan rivers. Here we analyse the sedimentary architecture, chronology and provenance of a major palaeochannel associated with many of these settlements. We show that the palaeochannel is a former course of the Sutlej River, the third largest of the present-day Himalayan rivers. Using optically stimulated luminescence dating of sand grains, we demonstrate that flow of the Sutlej in this course terminated considerably earlier than Indus occupation, with diversion to its present course complete shortly after ~8 ka. Indus urban settlements thus developed along an abandoned river valley rather than an active Himalayan river. Confinement of the Sutlej to its present incised course after ~8 ka likely reduced its propensity to re-route frequently thus enabling long-term stability for Indus settlements sited along the relict palaeochannel.},

  isbn             = {9780195395341},
  abstract         = {Description Yoga is so prevalent in the modern world--practiced by pop stars, taught in schools, and offered in yoga centers, health clubs, and even shopping malls--that we take its presence, and its meaning, for granted. But how did the current yoga boom happen? And is it really rooted in ancient Indian practices, as many of its adherents claim? In this groundbreaking book, Mark Singleton calls into question many commonly held beliefs about the nature and origins of postural yoga (?sana ) and suggests a radically new way of understanding the meaning of yoga as it is practiced by millions of people across the world today. Singleton shows that, contrary to popular belief, there is no evidence in the Indian tradition for the kind of health and fitness-oriented ?sana practice that dominates the global yoga scene of the twenty-first century. Singleton's surprising--and surely controversial--thesis is that yoga as it is popularly practiced today owes a greater debt to modern Indian nationalism and, even more surprisingly, to the spiritual aspirations of European bodybuilding and early 20th-century women's gymnastic movements of Europe and America, than it does to any ancient Indian yoga tradition. This discovery enables Singleton to explain, as no one has done before, how the most prevalent forms of postural yoga, like Ashtanga, Bikram and "Hatha" yoga, came to be the hugely popular phenomena they are today. Drawing on a wealth of rare documents from archives in India, the UK and the USA, as well as interviews with the few remaining, now very elderly figures in the 1930s Mysore ?sana revival, Yoga Body turns the conventional wisdom about yoga on its head.},
  annotation       = {Reviews "Singleton's radical, meticulously documented, sensitive analysis makes perfectly clear that what has come to be regarded as a veritable icon of Indic Civilization -- postural yoga -- is, in fact, unambiguously the hybrid product of colonial and post-colonial globalization.null --Prof. Joseph S. Alter, University of Pittsburgh. Author of Yoga in Modern India: The Body Between Science and Philosophy "Mark Singleton's Yoga Body: The Origins of Modern Posture Practice is an outstanding scholarly work which brings so much insight and clarity to the historic and cultural background of modern hatha yoga. I highly recommend this book, especially for all sincere students of yoga." --John Friend, Founder of Anusara Yoga "I have been reading yoga texts and practicing yoga for 40 years, and I have taught a university-level academic course on yoga for the last 15 years, so it takes quite a good deal to teach me things about yoga I did not already know. This book has done so. It has been extremely informative and is rich with historical details. The quantity of field research is quite extraordinary, the prose articulate, the diction intelligent, and the narrative sound. It is a must-read among yoga teachers and serious students, and has the potential to transform much of the yoga world. This book will echo loudly through the global yoga community." --Prof. Kenneth Liberman, University of Oregon. Author of Dialectical Practice in Tibetan Philosophical Culture "From the moment I started reading Mark Singleton's Yoga Body I couldn't put it down. It is beautifully written, extensively researched, and full of fascinating information. It stands alone in its depth of insight into a subject which has intrigued me for forty years." --David Williams, Maui, Hawaii. The first non-Indian to learn the complete Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga syllabus. "Mark Singleton has written a sweeping and nuanced account of the origins and development of modern postural yoga in early twentieth-century India and the West, arguing convincingly that yoga as we know it today does not flow directly from the Yoga Sutras or India's medieval ha?ha yoga traditions, but rather emerged out of a confluence of practices, movements and ideologies, ranging from contortionist acts in carnival sideshows, British Army calisthenics and women's stretching exercises to social Darwinism, eugenics, and the Indian nationalist movement. The richly illustrated story he tells is an especially welcome contribution to the history of yoga, demonstrating the ways in which an ancient tradition was reinvented against the backdrop of India's colonial experience." --Prof. David Gordon White, University of California, Santa Barbara. Author of The Alchemical Body, Siddha Traditions in Medieval India "Mark Singleton gives us here a groundbreaking, pioneering work. By carefully tracing the key 'missing links' in the development of contemporary notions of hatha yoga, he presents a far richer and nuanced picture than previously known. Quite simply, this is a book that cannot be ignored, destined to be reckoned with in any further study of the topic. Thoroughly researched, extraordinarily well informed, and lucidly argued, I recommended it very highly to all serious practitioners and students of modern yoga who want a deeper understanding of its evolution." --Carlos Pomeda, founder of Yoga Wisdom for Modern Life. "Mark Singleton's book Yoga Body traces the evolution of the ever expanding practice of asana world-wide. His work offers a much needed historical perspective that will help correct much of the mythology and group-think that is emerging in the modern asana based 'yoga world'. Any serious asana practitioner who wishes to understand the place of asana in the greater tradition of yoga will do well to read it carefully." --Gary Krafstow, the founder of the American Viniyoga Institute, author of Yoga for Wellness and Yoga for Transformation "Yoga Body by Mark Singleton is a scholarly exploration of how modern yoga, as currently practiced in countless studios, gyms, and schools across the country, evolved [\ldots ] In essence, this very popular form of yoga was greatly influenced by modern physical practices, not just traditional spiritual or mystical ones. Singleton makes a cogent argument backed up by references from many studies and sources [\ldots ] a work of merit that sheds a great deal of light on the development of modern yoga [\ldots ] an important contribution to our understanding of yoga." --San Francisco Book Review "Mark Singleton [\ldots ] asks a big question: Where did modern yoga come from? His reply will no doubt disturb a lot of folks [\ldots ] as Singleton clearly and convincingly demonstrates, the physical practice of today is less than 100 years old, and it has very little to do with either Patanjali's or Krishna's teaching. Instead, it's the product of such disparate elements as British colonialist policies in India, 19^th century physical health movements in Europe and India, the invention of the camera, and the reformist programs of Indian yoga teachers like Shri Yogendra and T. Krishnamacharya. This book, an invaluable source on modern yoga, should be on the reading list of every serious student and teacher training program." --Richard Rosen in Yoga Journal ."

  abstract     = {Starting from Madras, travelling across the Bay of Bengal, to the coast of Sumatra and then to Singapore, this paper provides a cultural history of nineteenth-century knowledge-making as an enterprise in making and breaking three concepts: globe, empire and self. It does so by working outwards from early-nineteenth century pendulum-length experiments to determine the curvature of the Earth. It argues that moving across concepts and scales was vital to a regime of big data. Data-crunching involved different sciences and split across territories and sea and land. As the project of making the globe proceeded, for instance from Madras Observatory, imperial settlements could be located precisely as coordinates, for instance British Singapore, and indigenous intellectuals, like Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir (1797–1854), had to find their place in a world of imperial free trade. Global model-making brought about a detachment from individuals and locations as people and places were fixed on a globe and it led to the erasure of the indigenous informant, a key figure in recent histories of science. In linking the making of the globe to the fate of intermediary, the argument urges the need to place indigenous agency in the sciences within wider accounts of labour, capital and imperial expansion.},

  sets forth the intellectual principles that inform his work. Writing as a practising historian, he
  considers the theoretical difficulties inherent in the pursuit of knowledge and interpretation,
  and elucidates the methodology which finds its expression in his two successive volumes. All
  of Professor Skinner's work is characterised by philosophical power, limpid clarity, and
  elegance of exposition; these essays, many of which are now recognised classics, provide a
  fascinating and convenient digest of the development of his thought.},

  abstract         = {In the following account of ritual efficacy, I discuss two ritual strategies for dealing with alleged cases of possession in India that reflect different notions of mental health care within religious contexts. I will supplement these discussions with reflections on a Sanskrit term that I believe is relevant to these two cases, a term that dates to the early centuries CE. The first of the two case studies involves healing at a temple in South India that came to my attention only after my book on deity and spirit possession in India (Smith 2006) was published. The second adds substantive material to discussions in that book (Smith 2006: 114ff., passim). The three are, in order: a description of psychiatric care proffered at a temple called Muthuswamy in Tamil nadu; an autobiographical account of spirit healing that I gathered in 2008 from a woman who had visited the Balaji temple in Mehndipur, Rajasthan; and a re-examination of the Sanskrit term sattvavajaya, which I mentioned in my 2006 book, but did not discuss extensively. In all three, the notion of embodiment is central. In the cases of the Muthuswamy and Balaji tamples, individuals seek cures because they themselves believe or are believed by members of their families to be possessed by untoward spirits that take over their bodies, causing undesired dissociation. The healings at these two temples, which work in entirely different ways, enable the afflicted individuals to regain possession of their bodies, thus unburdening the individual of the offending spirit and the dysfunctionality that it causes. Sattvavayaja, as understood from the Sanskrit texts and interpreted through the lens of a long history of possession and spirit healing in India (Smith 2006), is a general term for a kind of therapy that explicitly addresses notions of embodiment, even if the ayurvedic texts themselves are reticent about the details. Adapted from the source document.},

The article examines the construction of the text, looking at the creative ways in which Banarasidas builds subtle literary devices by exploiting features inherent in Hindi and in the metres chosen for the poem. It is suggested that a conventional critical approach to the poem, following traditional Sanskritic literary categories, can fail to perceive the strengths of this decidely vernacular composition, and that a new methodology of vernacular aesthetics is needed to do it justice. The problems of maintaining the poem's literary qualities in English translation are explored, both by examining published prose versions and by an experiment with metrical English verse.},

  abstract         = {http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Celsus/7*.html (consulted 12/1/2012) from Liber 7: 13 [Legamen ad versionem Latinam]I have already made mention elsewhere61 of p347cataract, because when of recent origin it is also often dispersed by medicaments: when it is more chronic it requires treatment by surgery, and this is one of the most delicate operations. Before I speak of this, the nature of the eyeball itself has to be briefly explained. A knowledge of this is often useful, but especially here. The eyeball, then, has two external tunics, of which the outer is called by the Greeks ceratoides.62 In that part of the eye which is white it is fairly thick; over the region of the pupil it is thin. bTo this tunic the under one is joined; in the middle where the pupil is, it is pierced by a small hole: around this it is thin, further out it too is thicker and is called by the Greeks chorioides.63 These two tunics whilst enclosing the contents of the eyeball, coalesce again behind it, and after becoming thinned out and fused into one, go through the space between the bones, and adhere to the membrane of the brain. Under these two tunics, at the spot where the pupil is, there is an empty space; then underneath again is the thinnest tunic, which Herophilus named arachnoides.64 cAt its middle the arachnoides is cupped, and contained in that hollow is what, from its resemblance to glass, the Greeks call hyaloides;65 it is humour, neither fluid nor thick, but as it were curdled, and upon its colour is dependent the colour of the pupil, whether black or steel-blue, since the outer tunic is quite white: but this humour is enclosed by that thin p349membrane which comes over it from the interior. In front of these is a drop of humour like white of egg, from which comes the faculty of seeing; it is named by the Greeks crystalloides.66 14 [Legamen ad versionem Latinam]Now either from disease or from a blow, a humour forms underneath the two tunics in what I have stated to be an empty space;67 and this as it gradually hardens is an obstacle to the visual power within. And there are several species of this lesion; some curable, some which do not admit of treatment. For there is hope if the cataract is small, and immobile, if it has also the colour of sea water or of glistening steel, and if at the side there persists some sensation to a flash of light. If large, if the black part of the eye has lost its natural configuration and is changed to another form, if the colour of the suffusion is sky blue or golden, if it shakes and moves this way and that, then it is scarcely ever to be remedied. bGenerally too the case is worse when the cataract has arisen from a severe disease, from severe pains68 in the head or from a blow of a violent kind. Old age is not favourable for treatment, since apart from this lesion, sharpness of vision is naturally dulled; neither is childhood favourable, but rather intermediate ages. Neither a small nor a sunken eye is satisfactory for treatment. And in the cataract itself, there is a certain development. Therefore we must wait until it is no longer fluid, but appears to have coalesced to some sort of hardness. Before p351treatment the patient should eat in moderation and for three days beforehand drink water, for the day before abstain from everything. cThen he is to be seated opposite the surgeon in a light room, facing the light, while the surgeon sits on a slightly higher seat; the assistant from behind holds the head so that the patient does not move: for vision can be destroyed permanently by a slight movement. In order also that the eye to be treated may be held more still, wool is put over the opposite eye and bandaged on: further the left eye should be operated on with the right hand, and the right eye with the left hand. dThereupon a needle is to be taken pointed enough to penetrate, yet not too fine; and this is to be inserted straight through the two outer tunics at a point intermediate between the pupil of the eye and the angle adjacent to the temple, away from the middle of the cataract, in such a way that no vein is wounded.69 The needle should not be, however, entered timidly, for it passes into the empty space; and when this is reached even a man of moderate experience cannot be mistaken, for there is then no resistance to pressure. eWhen the spot is reached, the needle is to be sloped against the suffusion itself and should gently rotate there and little by little guide it below the region of the pupil; when the cataract has passed below the pupil it is pressed upon most firmly in order that it may settle below.70 If it sticks there the cure is accomplished; if it returns to some extent, it is to be cut up with the same needle and separated into several pieces, which can be the more easily stowed away singly, and form smaller obstacles to vision. fAfter this the p353needle is drawn straight out; and soft wool soaked in white of egg is to be put on, and above this something to check inflammation; and then bandages. Subsequently the patient must have rest, abstinence, and inunction with soothing medicaments; the day following will be soon enough for food, which at first should be liquid to avoid the use of the jaws; then, when the inflammation is over, such as has been prescribed for wounds,71 and in addition to these directions it is necessary that water should for some time be the only drink.},

  abstract         = {Until less than a century ago, the two prevailing views of dreams as well as of souls were that they are inconsequential (the scientific view) or of divine origin (the religious view). In either case it was assumed that they cannot be objects of rational inquiry. Similar views still prevail regarding mystical experiences and mysticism in general. Modern Western opinion, whether friendly or hostile, holds that the mystical falls squarely within the domain of the irrational. Mr. Staal argues that mysticism can be studied rationally, and that without such study no theory of mind is complete. He exposes the grounds for the belief that mysticism cannot be studied, and shows them to be prejudices issuing from a particular historical development. While his contention has unflattering implications for the contemporary study of the humanities in general, it reveals in particular that existing academic approaches to the study of mysticism, even those that appear sound, are in fact inadequate. This conclusion applies to a variety of dogmatic inquiries and, as becomes clear in these pages, to philological, historical, phenomenological, sociological, physiological, and psychological ones as well. The illustrations in Exploring Mysticism are drawn mainly from Indian forms of mysticism such as Yoga, supplemented with Buddhist, Taoist, Muslim and Christian examples.},

  abstract  = {During the 7th to 9th centuries A.D. and later 10th to 14th centuries spreading of Buddhism in Tibet, numerous Buddhist Sanskrit manuscripts on palm leaves and, later, on paper were brought to Tibet to be translated. After their translation these Sanskrit manuscripts were used only rarely for study and as a rule were carefully kept in special chapels where they survived into the twentieth century. These original Sanskrit manuscripts are some of the greatest cultural treasures of the world. Two tasks of utmost importance are their preservation with the best available techniques and providing their accessibility to the scholarly community. These would constitute an invaluable contribution to international cooperation in the area of the humanities. Many of these manuscripts contain texts from the Indian Buddhist tradition that until today have only been known in their Tibetan translations or not known at all. For many years now, various individual scholars and academic institutions have been attempting to make the responsible institutions in Beijing and Lhasa aware of the need of making these treasures available to scholarship. In this book Steinkellner gives a general survey of these manuscripts' history and of the beginnings, the present state and the possible future of their return to the world of knowledge.},

Mysore 1969. \\ p.12: The treaty between Raghynātha Nāyaka of Tajore and Christian IV, King of Denmark and Norway, was concluded on 19th November 1620 through the agency of the Danish admiral Ove Giedde.\footnote{L. Laursen, Trait\'es du Danemark et de la Norv\`ege. Danmark-Norges Traktater 1523--1750 med dertil h\orende aktstykker}, Bd. III. K\obenhavn 1916, nr. 23, pp. 360--6. \\ The original, written on parchment in the Portuguese language, is preserved in the Danish National Archives. It stipulated the conditions for the acquisition of Tranquebar by Denmark and the relations between the two countries. The treaty, initially valid for two years only, was prolonged, and Tranquebar together with some territories acquired later were under Danish administration until they were sold to the English East India Company in 1845. The English occupied Tranquebar from 1801 to 1802 and again from 1808 to 1815. During the dispute which the first occupation brought about between Tanjore and Denmark, it was found that the treaty kept in Tanore was lost. Together with the treaty, Raghunātha Nāyaka issued a letter of friendship incised on a plate of pure gold; this letter is also preserved in the Danish National Archives and seems to be the only extant Indian diplomatica letter of that type on gold; samples on baser metals are numerous. \ldots [p.13] During the Mar\=\d tha reign it was the practice for the hig-level correspondence between Tanjore and Tranquebar to be carried out in Marāṭh\=i and the rest in Tamil. Letters from the Danish governors to King \'Seraphoji II were in some cases writtne in English instead. \\ p.14, ref. to Surendranath Sen, The Admiistrative System of the Marathas, 2nd ed., Calcutta 1925.},

  annotate         = {p.\,88:\begin{quote} Images of the Europeans also came to be available for the first time in Sanskrit, even if these seventeenth-century references tend to be sparse and rather laconic. An example is Venkatadhvarin's \emph{Viśvaguṇādarśacampū}, where two alternative views of the city of Madras are proposed by two opposed voices in the text.42 One of these voices again insists on the fact that these Europeans (here termed `Hūnas', or Huns) are to be associated with unusual products and devices (\emph{vastv adbhutam}, similar in spirit to the idea of the `ajā'ib), besides the fact that `they never take others' money unjustly, by force', and observe rules in punishment. The negative view of them, on the other hand, contemptuously terms them `white-faces' (\emph{śvetavadanāḥ}), and declares in no uncertain terms: `There is no-one worse than Hūnas in this world: they are merciless, they treat Brahmins with contempt, as if they were no better than blades of grass; language cannot express their vices; they care nothing for rules of purity.' This last gibe may once more be a reference to the lack of bodily cleanliness that Tahir Muhammad has expressed in his text. Such reflections find echoes as those of Venkatadhvarin in later Sanskrit texts such as the \emph{Sarvadevavilāsa} from the late eighteenth century, where too the \emph{śvetamukhas} (`white faces') are compared to the evil figure of Ravana.43\footnote{42 Porcher, \emph{Un poème satirique sanskrit}, Verses 502--6. For a discussion, see Narayana Rao et al., \emph{Symbols of Substance}, pp. 1--12.}, \end{quote}\\ p.\,90 \begin{quote} \ldots another important and relatively neglected text that comes to us from the 1770s and 1780s, namely the Malayalam travel account entitled \emph{Varttamāna\-ppustakam}, written by a certain Paremmakkal Tommakattanar (1736--99).\footnote[50]{50 For the Malayalam text, see Ulakamthara, ed., \emph{Varttamāna\-ppustakam, athavā Rommayātrā} For an English translation, see Cathanar Thomman Paremmakkal, \emph{The Varthamana\-ppusthakam}, trans. Placid J. Podipara. I am grateful to Kesavan Veluthat who drew my attention to this text.} The author of the text, a Syrian Christian man of the cloth, accompanied the bishop Mar Joseph Kariyattil, and visited Europe (Iberia and Rome) before returning to India, on a journey that has some parallels to that of Joseph of Cranganor in the early sixteenth century\ldots \end{quote} and discussion of this text continues to p.\,95.},

  abstract = {Recent years have seen the growing prominence of “global history” as a subject of research, especially in North America and Europe. However, there is no consensus on what the contours of the subject are, or what the appropriate research methods for it might be. Further, there are quite a few skeptics among historians with regard to this trend. The appearance of a volume on the subfield of “global intellectual history” is an occasion to reflect on all these issues, especially when the volume in question suggests that “the future of intellectual history as a discipline lies in this direction.” This review essay, while appreciative of the effort to lay out the contours of the field, as well as to point to possible future directions for research and reflection, is nevertheless somewhat critical of the actual execution of the project. It is found to be lacking in chronological depth, and also highly uneven in quality, as well as excessively centered on a few “great thinkers” such as Hegel and Marx. A greater attention to the centuries between 1500 and 1800, when a polycentric global regime of knowledge (however tenuous it proved) was established, would have been particularly helpful. Most important, there is the question of whether a history claiming to be “global,” as distinct from “universal,” should not pay closer attention to questions of space and geography.},

The disease is experienced by the patient and the physician, who has the knowledge of disease, conducts the diagnoses and provides treatment. This poses two questions: Does the patient, who experiences the disease, have knowledge? Does the physician, who knows the disease and its cure, have recourse to experience? How does epistemology address the relation between the ontology of the patient the layman and the doctor the specialist? After a presentation of the problematic as it reveals itself in the analysis of biomedicine, the paper proceeds, based on fieldwork with siddha practitioners in Tamil Nadu, to examine the siddha medicine approach to these issues.},

  abstract  = {The demand for cure and for the care of a growing range of health conditions which elude any particular system of medicine has made pluralism in therapeutic options a way of life. The spread and continuity of indigenous systems of medicines, namely, ayurveda, siddha and unani, have thrown up a lot of concerns as well: how to incorporate these systems into a centralised health infrastructure; their expansion through the pharmaceutical industry for herbal products, massage centres and spas; the relations and negotiations between the practitioners of different coexisting systems of medicine; the position of psychosocial and spiritual dimensions of cure and care in contemporary forms of indigenous systems of medicine and the debate on notions of efficacy in multiple, coherent systems of medicine. All these are worth serious study as they raise fundamental questions not just about ISMS, but about organising healthcare in India. A framework for the analysis of ISMS requires not only recognising the presence of diverse medical systems, but engaging with them as live and efficacious traditions. The collection of papers in this special issue attempts to address some of these matters.},

It was not, however, until the 1730s that copies of the Vedas were first obtained by Europeans, even though Jesuit missionaries had been collecting Indian religious texts since the 1540s. I argue that the delay owes as much to the relative absence of the Vedas in India-and hence to the greater practical significance for missionaries of other genres of religious literature-as to reluctance on the part of Brahmin scholars to transmit their texts to Europeans.},

  abstract         = {Summary: Yoga's history in America is longer and richer than even its most devoted
  practitioners realize. It was present in Emerson's New England, and by the turn of the twentieth
  century it was fashionable among the leisure class. And yet when Americans first learned about
  yoga, what they learned was that it was a dangerous, alien practice that would corrupt body
  and soul. A century later, you can find yoga in gyms, malls, and even hospitals, and the arrival of
  a yoga studio in a neighborhood is a signal of cosmopolitanism. How did it happen? It did so,
  Stefanie Syman explains, through a succession of charismatic yoga teachers, who risked charges
  of charlatanism as they promoted yoga in America, and through generations of yoga students,
  who were deemed unbalanced or even insane for their efforts. "The Subtle Body" tells the
  stories of these people, including Henry David Thoreau, Pierre A. Bernard, Margaret Woodrow
  Wilson, Christopher Isherwood, Sally Kempton, and Indra Devi. From New England, the book
  moves to New York City and its new suburbs between the wars, to colonial India, to postwar Los
  Angeles, to Haight-Ashbury in its heyday, and back to New York City post-9/11. In vivid chapters,
  it takes in celebrities from Gloria Swanson and George Harrison to Christy Turlington and
  Madonna. And it offers a fresh view of American society, showing how a seemingly arcane and
  foreign practice is as deeply rooted here as baseball or ballet. This epic account of yoga's rise is
  absorbing and often inspiring - a major contribution to our understanding of our society.},

  annotation       = {Textual criticism--the traditional term for the task of evaluating the authority of the words and punctuation of a text--is often considered an undertaking preliminary to literary criticism: many people believe that the job of textual critics is to provide reliable texts for literary critics to analyze. G. Thomas Tanselle argues, on the contrary, that the two activities cannot be separated. The textual critic, in choosing among textual variants and correcting what appear to be textual errors, inevitably exercises critical judgment and reflects a particular point of view toward the nature of literature. And the literary critic, in interpreting the meaning of a work or passage, needs to be (though rarely is) critical of the makeup of every text of it, including those produced by scholarly editors. "Of course, nobody with any previous interest in the subject needs to hear encouraging praise about the author or the quality of the Rosenbach Lecture Series."--American Literature "A strangely evocative, even a moving book, a rara avis in textual circles. . . . A calm, beautifully articulated peroration that should be required reading for all critics, literary or textual. . . . Tansell's Rationale is one further demonstration of the attempts to 'step outside,' for in its call to all the citizens of the great republic of arts and letters it allows us to overcome the narrow prejudices which we may have inherited and to put our scholarship and our criticism at the service of human communication in all its manifestations. This is the final polemic of the book, and it is an heroic one indeed. That it has succeeded so well, not least in its artfully modulated language, is a tribute to the comprehensiveness and liberality of the mind of its author."--Review "These short, lucid, well-written, humane lectures are essential reading for graduate and undergraduate students concerned with texts of any kind requiring critical attention--and for their teachers."--Review of English Studies G. Thomas Tanselle is Vice President of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation and Adjunct Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University.},

A devoted warrior who fought by the bloodthirsty standards of his time, Babur was also a gifted scholar and ethnographer, and his memoir, <b>The Baburnama</b>--which translator and editor Wheeler Thackston heralds as the first autobiography in Islamic literature--paints a fascinating portrait of the lands he conquered, such as Hindustan: "A strange country. Compared to ours, it is another world. Its mountains, rivers, forests, and wildernesses, its villages and provinces, animals and plants, peoples and languages, even its rain and winds are altogether different." They were different indeed, and we're fortunate to have this beautifully illustrated record of Babur's wonderment at the new places he saw.} {Both an official chronicle and the highly personal memoir of the emperor Babur (1483-1530), <i>The Baburnama</i> presents a vivid and extraordinarily detailed picture of life in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India during the late-fifteenth and early-sixteenth centuries. Babur's honest and intimate chronicle is the first autobiography in Islamic literature, written at a time when there was no historical precedent for a personal narrative. Now in a sparkling new translation by Islamic scholar Wheeler Thackston.<br><br>This Modern Library Paperback Classics edition includes notes, indices, maps, and illustrations.}},

Chronologically it covers everything from the Vedic period up to the Hindu kingdoms before the establishment of Muslim rule.

Professional training, the role of the teacher and of foreign languages are dealt with, and the impact of the peculiar features of Indian education on Indian society.\\ pp.119ff. debates and debating recorded in ancient literature},

  abstract         = {This dissertation examines the concept of living liberation in the Tirumantiram, a work recognised as one of the Tamil Saiva canonical texts composed around the ninth century. Modern scholarship has thus far attempted to comprehend the Tirumantiram in terms of the post-Tirumantiram traditions that developed after the thirteenth century: Tamil Saiva Siddhànta and Tamil Siddha. Consequently, the unity and coherence of the text are subjected to question, and the dual literary and cultural roots of the Tirumantiram remain largely uninvestigated. Besides, the significance of the Tirumantiram as one of the earliest vernacular works directly dealing with the question of soteriology for Tamil speaking populace, most of whom are not qualified for liberation and preceptorhood according to the Saivàgamas with which the text identifies itself, is not fully recognised. This dissertation argues that the concept of living liberation constitutes the unifying theme of the Tirumantiram, which is an outcome of the synthesis of Tamil and Sanskrit traditions, and demonstrates that the Tirumantiram-which does not apparently promote the ideology of temple cult around which the Tamil bhakti movement and Saivàgamas of Southern Saivism developed–exemplifies an alternative religious vision centred on the human body. This dissertation consists of four chapters. The first chapter examines the Tamil legacy to the concept of living liberation. The second examines the ambiguous relations between the Sanskrit traditions and the Tirumantiram. How the Tamil and Sanskrit traditions are fused together to produce a unique version of yoga, the means to attain living liberation, is the concern of the third chapter. The final chapter establishes through an analysis of sexual symbolism expressed in connotative language that the Tirumantiratm is an esoteric text. Thus, the Tirumantiram reflects the blending of an esoteric tantric sect with the leading mainstream bhakti religion, probably to win approval of and recognition in the Tamil Saiva community during the medieval period.},

Asked to tell her story, she said, as well as she could through her cut and swollen lips, that when her husband had dies, his brother had claimed her in order to get his estate; but as she was unwilling to marry him, he cut off her nose, and slit her lips, and cast her forth. She had gone straight to Bann{\'u}, and Zabita Khan had performed a very neat operation, having supplied what was wanted from her cheeks instead of her forehead, as was usual. Two quills did duty for the time as nostrils. This old Malik has always three or four patients on hand. On one occasion I saw five at his house, three women and two men. The former had lost their noses for unfaithfulness; the latter for attempting intrigues with other men's wives." Kindly sent by Mike Miles},

However, these language analyses have been largely unexplored in modern scholarship. Select works have occasionally been noticed, but the majority of such texts languish unpublished. Furthermore, these works remain untheorized as a sustained, in-depth response on the part of India’s traditional elite to tremendous political and cultural changes. These bilingual grammars and lexicons are one of the few direct, written ways that Sanskrit intellectuals attempted to make sense of Indo-Persian culture in premodern and early modern India. Here I provide the most comprehensive account to date of the texts that constitute this analytical tradition according to three major categories: general lexicons, full grammars, and specialized glossaries. I further draw out the insights offered by these materials into how early modern thinkers used language analysis to try to understand the growth of Persian on the subcontinent.},

  abstract         = {This article presents the first in-depth textual analysis of the Razmnamah (Book of War), the Persian translation of the Mahabharata sponsored by the Mughal emperor Akbar in the late sixteenth century. I argue that the Razmnamah was a central literary work in the Mughal court and of deep relevance to Akbar’s imperial and political ambitions. I pursue my analysis of the Mughal Mahabharata in two sections, focusing first on the work’s Sanskrit sources and then on the translation practices one finds evidenced in the Persian text. In the first section, I outline how the Mughal translators accessed Sanskrit materials and identify the Sanskrit texts that served as the basis for the Persian translation. This framework helps reconstruct the nature of the Mahabharata as the Mughals knew it and provides both the conceptual and literary tools needed to pursue comparative textual analysis. In the second section, I examine the text of the Razmnamah in comparison with its Sanskrit sources to highlight some of the Mughal translators’ key strategies in reimagining the epic in Persian. This close reading traces several literary paradigms that offer insight into the crucial role the Razmnamah played in the production and reproduction of Mughal imperial culture. Taken as a whole, my analysis argues that the Razmnamah was a crucial component of the politico-cultural fashioning of Akbar’s court, whereby the Mughals developed a new type of Indo-Persian imperial aesthetic.},

  abstract         = {In this dissertation, I analyze interactions between Sanskrit and Persian literary cultures at the Mughal court during the years 1570-1650 C.E. During this period, the Mughals rose to prominence as one of the most powerful dynasties of the early modern world and patronized Persian as a language of both literature and empire. Simultaneously, the imperial court supported Sanskrit textual production, participated in Sanskrit cultural life, and produced Persian translations of Sanskrit literature. For their part, Sanskrit intellectuals became influential members of the Mughal court, developed a linguistic interest in Persian, and wrote extensively about their imperial experiences. Yet the role of Sanskrit at the Mughal court remains a largely untold story in modern scholarship, as do the resulting engagements across cultural lines. To the extent that scholars have thought about Sanskrit and Persian in tandem, they have generally been blinded by their own language barriers and mistakenly asserted that there was no serious interaction between the two. I challenge this uncritical view through a systematic reading of texts in both languages and provide the first detailed account of exchanges between these traditions at the Mughal court. I further argue that these cross-cultural events are central to understanding the construction of power in the Mughal Empire and the cultural and literary dynamics of early modern India.},

A vast preponderance of our knowledge derives not from personal experience but from books, newspapers, journals, teachers, and experts. In other words our knowledge comes, directly or indirectly, from the testimony of others, in paritcular from those we trust.

  abstract             = {{Science and technology have created many of the problems besetting us at the turn of the century, yet, paradoxically, we cannot address them without their assistance. This beautifully illustrated book takes a fresh approach to resolving the problems of progress and modernity by reframing science and technology.<br>In an eclectic and highly original study, Turnbull brings together a wide range of traditions as diverse as cathedral building, Micronesian navigation, cartography and turbulence research. He argues that all our differing ways of producing knowledge, including science, are messy, spatial and local. Every culture has its own ways of assembling local knowledge, thereby creating space through the linking of people, practices and places. The spaces we inhabit and assemblages we work with are not as homogeneous and coherent as our modernist perspectives have led us to believe-rather they are complex and heterogeneous motleys.}},

Those documents are the recorded history, culture and identity of a nation. Realizing its value and significant it has become the concern of national and international communities for storage, preservation, digitization, and access through creating standard metadata. Large number of heritage related documents are available in South East Asia region including Nepal. The manuscript contains vast amount of knowledge on subjects like Buddhism tradition and belief, customary laws, tradition medicines, astrology, history folktales, worship of gods and goddesses which are written in Sanskrit, old Newari language, Pali and so on. In the case of Nepal, the country possesses century old vast quantities of valuable manuscripts mostly written in gold and silver letters in varied language like Sanskrit, Hindi, Awadhi, which attract scholars from all over the world. Libraries, archives, museum, religious people have stored and preserved those oldest and rarest manuscripts in their own way. Regarding digitization aspect too those institutions and libraries are adopting different standards particularly with respect to metadata of the materials. This is the same mostly all over south and South- East Asia including Nepal. However, what is more important to do is to develop standard method for metadata production before preserving and digitization with an aim to bring uniformity in data management and accessibility of data of manuscripts all over the world.},

  abstract         = {This dissertation examines a group of nineteenth-century English and Bengali translators of Patanjali's Yoga Sutra (c. 200 C.E.), a classical Sanskrit text on yoga philosophy and practice. These translators, based in and around colonial Calcutta (contemporary Kolkata, India), were the first to publish English and Indian vernacular-language editions of the text. The study examines the context in which this community of translators worked and analyzes how local and cosmopolitan contexts influenced the reception of the Yoga Sutra before Swami Vivekananda's interpretation of it as a central and universal scripture of Hinduism (1896). The community of translators I analyze consisted of British scholars of Sanskrit associated with the formation of colonial India, British missionaries who were at times in tension with those scholars, and indigenous Sanskrit intellectuals who sought new audiences by translating the Yoga Sutra into vernacular languages (principally Bengali, although also Hindi) as well as English. The process of translating the Yoga Sutra when viewed in the context of colonial Calcutta represents of a diversification of the interpretation of Patanjali's increasingly canonical text to engage a set of vernacular concerns. In this respect, translation served as a kind of continuation of precolonial practices that localized the Sanskritic in various contexts. Through an examination of the reception of the text by this translation community, I argue that the work of these translators expanded the semantic range of interpretation for subsequent commentary on yoga. The study shows how a community of translators in a colonial context interpreted a precolonial text, using translation as a means of commentary to address processes of religious transformation.},

Openness and secrecy are often interlocked, impossible to take apart, and they might even reinforce each other. They should be understood as positive (instead of privative) categories that do not necessarily stand in opposition to each other. In the second part of this paper, I call for a historicization of the concepts of ‘openness’ and ‘secrecy’. Focusing on the early modern period, I briefly introduce three kinds of secrecy that are difficult to analyse with a simple oppositional understanding of openness and secrecy. In particular, I focus on secrecy in relation to esoteric traditions, theatricality and allegory.},

Rather, it is people who shape their culture by constantly manipulating conventional symbols taken from a variety of everchanging codes to create new meanings. Wagner sees culture arising from the dialectic between the individual and the social world; his analysis is situated in the relation between invention and convention, innovation and control, meaning and context. Finally, the author points out that the symbolization processes that generate the construction of meaning in culture are the same as those that anthropologists use to "invent" the cultures they study.},

A. Bayly (1996), Thomas R. Trautmann (1999a, 1999b), William R. Pinch (1999), Richard M. Eaton (2000), Norbert Peabody (2001), Mohamad Tavakoli-Targhi (2001), and others. Most of these contributions would appear to share the point of departure of the established postcolonialist position--namely, that knowledge is power and that colonial knowledge did lay a fundamental role in the consolidation of colonial rule. They depart from the postcolonialists, however, in questioning the assumption that the colonized were mere passive bystanders to the process, and in pointing to significant elements of continuity, epistemic and otherwise, running across the presumed colonial divide. In particular, some of these works have called attention to the active role of the colonized in producing colonial knowledge. Whereas the post-colonialists have tended to see native scholars merely as ``informants," providing raw data with which active Europeans produced colonial knowledge, the ``collaborationists" have instead viewed these indigenous intellectuals as active partners in the process, bringing their own forms of knowledge and epistemic regimes to the dialogue. \end{quote}},

Under these conditions, the Ratnavali must have been written during the reign of Yajña Sri, because prior to his reign, there is no evidence for the motif of Buddhas on lotuses in the Satavahana kingdom. This hypothesis will hold until someone either discovers an earlier image of a Buddha on a lotus, until someone establishes that this motif existed in some other medium while it was being avoided in stone, or until some- one finds convincing evidence proving that Nagarjuna did not write the Ratnavali.},

  abstract         = {In India today, the sick can choose from a range of medical options, including Western biomedicine, homeopathy, Sanskritic ayurveda, Tamil siddha, Islamic unani, and Gandhian nature cure, among others. This variety might seem surprising, given the rapid globalization of the medicines, institutions, and explanatory apparatus of Western medicine. While penicillin cures many ailments, however, the complexities of human health and medical experience leave much to chance, to cultural interpretations of healing, and to the imagination. Traditional doctors continue to thrive in the modern world, says Richard Weiss, because they employ imaginative resources that speak to the sense of identity, hope, and duty of millions of people. In this book, Weiss seeks to illuminate the present success of traditional doctors by examining the ways that siddha practitioners in Tamil South India have won the trust and patronage of patients. They do this, he shows, by offering affiliation to a timeless and pure community, the fantasy of a Tamil utopia, and even the prospect of immortality. They construct an imaginative, utopian world of a potent and pure Tamil medicine that stands in contrast to the manifest world of contemporary Tamil society, a world in which they vie with biomedical doctors for medical authority and clientele. This imagined world is not idle fantasy, argues Weiss, because it suggests work that Tamils should set for themselves: the recuperation of this utopian world through collecting and systematizing its scattered remains. In other words, siddha doctors hope to merge these two worlds, to reveal the traditional world to modernity, and to make siddha medical knowledge available to public scrutiny. such a merger, they suggest, will reveal to the world the glory of Tamil medicine and culture, which at this point exists most robustly in the hopeful writings of Tamil revivalism.},

  abstract         = {Over the past fifty years, a number of approaches to the recovery of the multiple pasts of Hinduism have held the field. these include that of the discipline of History of religions as it is constituted in north america as well as those of the Hindu nationalists, the colonial and post-colonial historians, and the subaltern studies school. None of these approaches have proven satisfactory because, for methodological or ideological reasons, none have adequately addressed human agency or historical change in their accounts of the pasts out of which modern-day Hinduism has emerged. the Hindu nationalist historians hark back to an extended Vedic golden age in which religious practice remained unchanged until the corruptions spawned by the Turkish invasions of the eleventh century. Many Western indologists and historians of religion specializing in Hinduism never leave the unalterable ideal worlds of the scriptures they interpret to investigate the changing real-world contexts out of which those texts emerged. The colonial and postcolonial historians focus on the past two hundred years as the period in which all of the categories through which India continues to interpret itself—including Hinduism—were imposed upon it from without. Adducing examples of Hindu practitioners and thinkers from the colonial period, subaltern theorists and others argue that historical thought is itself alien to the authentic Indian mind. This article suggests a number of interpretive strategies for retrieving the multiple Hinduisms of the past and of the medieval period in particular as that time out of which most modern-day practices of Hinduism emerged. These include an increased emphasis on non-scriptural sources and a focus on regional traditions.},

Marketed as a clear path to self-realization, mind expansion, and taut abs, yoga is also perceived as an ancient and unchanging Indian tradition based on the revelations of benign and limber sages. But this modern conception of yoga derives from nineteenth-century European spirituality, "Sinister Yogis" reveals, and the true story of yoga's origins in South Asia is far richer, stranger, and much more entertaining. To uncover this history, David Gordon White focuses on yoga's practitioners. Combing through millennia of South Asia's vast and diverse literature, he discovers that yogis are usually portrayed as wonder-workers or sorcerers who use their dangerous supernatural abilities - which can include raising the dead, possession, and levitation - to acquire power, money, and sexual gratification. As White shows, even those yogis who aren't downright villainous bear little resemblance to Western assumptions about them. By turns rollicking and sophisticated, "Sinister Yogis" tears down the image of yogis as detached, contemplative teachers, finally placing them in their proper context.},

Although the establishment of a technical terminology is not the cause of a dis- cipline's scientization, it does signal agreement by investigators over what shall be considered a metaphysical and what a scientific problem. A metaphysical problem is that which cannot be formulated in the technical language employed by practitioners of the discipline to frame questions or provide answers to them. In a field such as history, then, the confusion of a metaphysical with a scientific question is not only possible but at some stage in a given investigation inevitable. And although professional historians claim to be able to distinguish between ``proper history" on the one side and ``metahistory" on the other, in fact the distinction has no adequate theoretical justification. Every ``proper history" presupposes a ``metahistory" which is nothing but the web of commitments which the historian makes in the course of his interpretation on the aesthetic, cognitive, and ethical levels differentiated above.},

  abstract         = {The Buddhist saints, that are the subject of this article, are known from a series of inscribed reliquaries collected by Alexander Cunningham and F. C. Maisey at Sanchi and neighbouring sites in central India. The inscriptions, dating to the circa early first century BC, have been known since readings of them were first published the mid-nineteenth century. The detailed re-examination of the records presented in this article shows that the reliquary inscriptions give special prominence to five Buddhist saints. The names given correspond to the five missionaries who, according to Pali sources, were sent to the Himalayan region at the time of the Third Council in the mid-third century BC. This indicates that (a) the Hemavata school was responsible for the re-vitalization of Sanchi in the post-Mauryan period and (b) that there was a well-established tradition about the nature of the Third Council in the first century BC.},

  abstract         = {In 1835 a decision was made to use government educational funds in British India solely for the promotion of education in the English language. Macaulay's famous eulogy of the English tongue proved decisive in defeating the sponsors of the classical Indian languages. It is not generally recognized that the vernacular languages were then advanced as a third possibility. From 1835 to 1839 William Adam, Brian Houghton Hodgson, Frederick Shore and William Campbell worked to rescind the decree favoring English. Their literary campaign included a defense of the vernaculars against the charge that they were unable to convey modern concepts; and it included, too, the claim that greater numbers would be reached by this medium. Their efforts forced the Governor-General to review the whole question in 1839, and, although the earlier decision was upheld, vernacular education was later financed both in British India and in British Africa.},
  annotation       = {p.257: "The decree itself provided that all funds of the government should thereafter be used for promoting study of the English language. It would not destroy the native schools long as the natives continued to support them. The decree abandoned government stipends for students entering the oriental schools, and no funds were to be alloted for the printing of oriental works. To those who attacked this policy as an attempt to annihilate the languages India, one of the foremost apologists for the Bentinck decree replied: "Is the withholding of direct positive encouragement \ldots equivalent to a direct active discouragement, amounting to a general extermination?" This was, he argued, to only a return a policy of non-interference---alas, a sacred tenet of whiggery!"},

  abstract  = {Across Victorian Britain, in castles and cottages, rectories and pubs, and even hospitals and churches, thousands of women and hundreds of men were put into mesmeric trances. Apparently reasonable human beings twisted into bizarre postures, called out in unknown languages, and placidly bore assaults that should have caused unbearable pain. The Victorians were literally entranced - mesmerized - with this phenomenon.

Alison Winter's cultural history considers this pervasive pursuit as a central aspect of Victorian culture. Winter describes who was entranced, who did the entrancing, why mesmerism was such a compelling experience to so many, and how to others it became powerful evidence of fraud and "unscientific" behavior. Her account traces the history of mesmerism as it moved through Victorian society. As a result, Mesmerized is both a social history of the age and a lively exploration of the contested territory between science and pseudoscience. It provides an illuminating and original perspective on the Victorian social body and on nineteenth-century culture in general.},

In the world everything is as it is, and everything happens as it does happen: in it no value exists--and if it did exist it would have no value. If there is any value that does have value, it must lie outside the whole sphere of what happens and is the case. For all that happens and is the case is accidental. What makes it non-accidental cannot lie within the world, since if it did it would itself be accidental. It must lie outside the world. 6.4311 Death is not an event of life. Death is not lived through. If by eternity is understood not endless temporal duration but timelessness, then he lives eternally who lives in the present. Our life is endless in the way that our visual field is without limit. 6.53 The correct method in philosophy would really be the following: to say nothing except what can be said, i.e. propositions of natural science--i.e. something that has nothing to do with philosophy--and then, whenever someone else wanted to say something metaphysical, to demonstrate to him that he had failed to give a meaning to certain signs in his propositions. Although it would not be satisfying to the other person--he would not have the feeling that we were teaching him philosophy--this method would be the only strictly correct one. 6.54 My propositions serve as elucidations in the following way: anyone who understands me eventually recognizes them as nonsensical, when he has used them--as steps--to climb up beyond them. (He must, so to speak, throw away the ladder after he has climbed up it.) He must transcend these propositions, and then he will see the world aright. 7 What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence.},

Who were the "Aryans"? What was their spiritual and material culture and their outlook on life? Did they ever enter the Indian subcontinent from the outside? Or did this people develop indigenously in the Greater Panjab? This, the "Aryan" question, has kept minds - and politicians - busy for the past 200 years; it has been used and misused in many ways. And, its discussion has become a cottage industry in India during recent years. In this paper, it will be attempted to present the pros and contras for the (non-)occurrence of a movement of an "Aryan" population and its consequences.},

This knowledge is deposited in the krishishastras literature 'textbooks of agriculture', in didactic poetry or single chapters or passages of literary works of different genres and in various collections of popular sayings. These texts together are rich mines of information on the methods of weather forecast, the main events of the agricultural year comprising agricultural operations, events of village life and certain religious beliefs. Gyula Wojtilla in the first part of his book defines the various meanings of the term krishishastra and assigns its role among traditional sciences in India. It is followed by the major part of the book containing the detailed description of individual works on traditional agriculture written mainly in Sanskrit but also in Prakrit and in vernaculars such as Bengali, Bihari, Gujarati, Hindi, Kanarese, Malayalam, Maithili, Marathi, Rajasthani, Tamil and Telugu. At the end of the book there are four appendices comprising texts containing independent chapters) on the subject, collections of sayings others than ascribed to authors and miscellaneus issues. The book as such can be regarded as an literary encyclopaedia of traditional Indian agriculture and may serve as an indispensable tool of research for students of classical Indology, history of science and culture or the peasant society in India.},

  title       = {Ayurveda in the Age of Biomedicine: Discursive Asymmetries and Counter-strategies},
  abstract    = {Since the beginning of the British colonial enterprise in India the representation of
the relationship between Western biomedicine and Ayurveda has been based on a
fundamental epistemological asymmetry. However much Ayurveda was represented
in Orientalist literature as accurate, poetic, useful, scholarly, or interesting, it could
never occupy with authority the privileged place of the scientific that was central to
the rhetoric of colonial rationality. In postcolonial India the practice of Ayurveda, its
textual and intellectual production, socialization, treatment, public health education,
scientific debate, research, and pharmaceutical commerce, all take place in the
shadow of this biomedical hegemony. This dissertation analyzes the historical
contingencies of this asymmetry, its instantiation in the discursive practices of
contemporary Ayurveda practitioners, and the counter-strategies developed and
deployed in the context of Ayurveda’s scientific modernization and
institutionalization. First, I describe the textual codification of this asymmetrical
disciplinary alignment in the genre of British colonial compendia of materia medica,
and the efforts of anti-colonial apologists to regiment the two disciplines as separate
yet equal approaches to a unified human body, an ideology which I call medical
parallelism. Next, I describe the social effects of this ideology at Ayurveda
institutions in Kerala, focusing in particular on how Ayurveda’s disciplinary
boundaries are organized by practices of pedagogy, displays of expertise, and
scientific debate. Lastly, I describe the current transformations of Ayurveda’s
disciplinary boundaries through the commodification and globalization of Ayurveda
drugs. My analysis throughout the dissertation focuses on the production,
ideologization, and institutionalization of discursive action, which, I argue, effect the
stabilization of the function of linguistic reference as a medium of ideological signs.
This stabilization of ideological reference, I argue, is a semiotic condition of the
macro-historical processes of Ayurveda’s modernization, institutionalization, and
commodification. Thus, this dissertation demonstrates an approach to history that
centers on the discourse-pragmatic underpinnings of large-scale social change. In
the conclusion of this dissertation I address this discourse-pragmatic analysis of
Ayurveda’s postcolonial history to the challenge of formulating a critical discourse
of modernity that can account for the diversity of the kinds of experiences and
historical processes often glossed as “modernization.”},

The object of the yogi’s enlightenment-realization is dharma and dharmin: The dharma is the true nature of real things, e.g., momentariness, while the dharmin is real things i.e., momentary things. During the practice of meditation, dharma is directly grasped in the process of clear manifestation (viśadābhā) and the particular dharmin is indirectly ascertained in the process of determination (adhyavasāya). So, even though a yogi does not directly perceive any actual thing, s/he is still nonetheless able to undertake practical activity directed toward it. The realization of the Four Noble Truths consists of two aspects: firstly, the manifestation of momentariness, etc., in the stream of the yogi’s consciousness; secondly, the ascertainment of momentariness, etc., in whatever s/he happens to encounter.},

Interventions discussed include those applied at the levels of the patient (patient engagement and disclosure), the caregiver (education, teamwork, and checklists), the local workplace (culture and workplace changes), and the system (information technology and incident reporting systems). Promising interventions include forcing functions, computerized prescriber order entry with decision support, checklists, standardized handoffs and simulation training. Many of the interventions described still lack strong evidence of benefit, but this should not hold back implementation. Rather, it should spur innovation accompanied by evaluation and publication to share the results.},

Numerous textual extracts and illustrations in every chapter capture the historical cultures of past civilizations and demonstrate the different forms that historical consciousness has taken around the world.

  abstract         = {\begin{quote}Dominik Wujastyk: A medicine that has stood the test of time From a talk given at Asia House by the Associate Curator for South Asian Collections at the Wellcome Library in London 24 July 2001 The classical medicine of India, ayurveda in Sanskrit, is highly systematic. Today, ayurveda is beginning to take a place in the West alongside other complementary and alternative therapies. This is happening fast, and as it does so, ayurveda is changing, and to some extent being dumbed down. Thus, what we can easily find out about it today is often only its teaching that the body's wellbeing is a function of three humours, wind, bile and phlegm. There is a great deal more to ayurveda than this, and I would like to convey, if I can, a sense of the complexity and subtlety of this medical system in its original setting. Ayurvedic medicine is old, with roots going back to the time of the Buddha, who - according to the latest scholarship - probably died in about 400 BC. From its beginnings at this time, ayurvedic theory and practice was gradually developed and formalised until, about 2,000 years ago, several huge medical encyclopedias were compiled in Sanskrit, the precise and beautiful classical language of India. Three of these have survived up to the present; several other major works have been lost forever. But the works that survived are substantial, and cover a wide range of topics, from diagnosis through therapy, herbal medicine, and even refined surgery. In subsequent centuries, ayurvedic literature and practice continued to evolve, with thousands of textbooks, monographs, dictionaries, and other works being written, right up to the 19th century. New ayurvedic works in Sanskrit are occasionally composed even now, though they are virtuoso gestures to a glorious tradition rather than organic products of a living system of medicine. In addition to the extensive formal herbal knowledge available in the ayurvedic tradition, therapies such as oil massage, evacuations, cleansing, and exercise are all discussed in detail. Great attention is paid to the interaction between the personal constitution of the patient, the time, and the diet. The patient's regimen must change with the time of the year, and the food eaten and the exercise taken must be in sympathy with it. Thus, hot foods are prescribed for winter, and cooling foods for summer. Ayurveda is not homeopathic: treatment is a matter of balancing out opposing forces in the body, and restoring equilibrium. These ideas are not, however, just vague well-meaning suggestions. Traditionally, it took 12 years to train an ayurvedic physician. In this time, the physician would become extremely proficient in herbal lore, but would also learn about the six flavours that are present in every food, and how these flavours can inflame or pacify the humours. The student would learn about the 20 physical qualities of every medicinal substance, and about its two potencies, and the changes that would take place in the effect of a medicine as it underwent digestion. It is only in the last few decades that the traditional medicine of India itself has begun to find a wide and receptive audience outside India, especially in the United States, Britain, Italy, and Germany. But only a fraction of the medical wisdom of ayurveda is represented as it comes into our shops in London and Manhattan. In both India and Sri Lanka today, ayurveda is officially supported at the government level. It forms a respected component of national healthcare provision, although the proportion of the health budget spent on ayurveda is small compared with that spent on biomedicine. There are government colleges, clinics, hospitals, and accredited programs of professional training, qualification and licensing. Outside South Asia, ayurveda is having to find its place in a different marketplace, that of complementary and alternative medicine. As this happens, it is becoming imperative that practitioners and medical suppliers organise into professional associations in order to provide the accreditation and validation necessary to participate in the modern medical marketplace.\end{quote}},

Its purpose is to locate, document, preserve and disseminate the knowledge content of Indian manuscripts. While looking ahead to reconnect with the knowledge of the past, the Mission is in the process of trying to re-contextualize the knowledge contained in manuscripts for the present and the future generations. The Mission organizes seminars on various subjects related to Indian Knowledge in different locations of India. The papers presented in the seminar are collected and brought out under the Samiksika series. In 2006, the Mission organized a seminar on the theme “Saving India’s Medical Manuscripts” in collaboration with FRLHT, Bangalore. The Seminar dealt with various perspectives of Indian Medical Manuscripts. The scholars and experts in the related field put forth their views, interact and formulate plans for future research in the filed.},

If MSS started to be created in numbers from about 100 BC, then the first generation of MSS would have been starting to become unusable in about 200 AD.

  abstract         = {Popular attention has recently been captured by the results of the Bodleian Library's 2017 project of radiocarbon dating portions of the birch-bark fragments constituting what is known as the Bakhshālī Manuscript.  In this paper, we disagree with the interpretation of the findings announced by the Bodleian team. In particular, we argue that the earliest dated folio of this manuscript is unlikely to be the date of the whole text. Rather, the latest dateable folio is logically the date of the scribal activity. This fits well with past estimates of the date of the Bakhshālī Manuscript based on historical, philological and palaeographic arguments..  And we argue that the Bakhshālī Manuscript does include written zeros that function as arithmetical operators, i.e., as numbers in their own right, and not merely as place-holders, as asserted by the Bodleian team. Finally, we express regret that the Bodleian Library chose to announce scientific results without peer-review and through a press release to newspapers and a YouTube video.},

Rather, the author must have been at least a generation later than Mādhavācārya. Two possible candidates which have been proposed are [1] the son of Sāyaṇa — whose name Māyaṇa is to be considered a corruption or regional form of "Mādhava", and [2] Cannibhaṭṭa, the naiyāyika author of the Tarkabhāṣāprakāśikā – either independently or as part of a committee. There is no direct proof to support either choice; the available evidence, however, allows each to be given serious consideration as possible candidates for the authorship. At most, we can say with certainty that under either claim, the Sarvadarśanasaṅgraha would have been composed during the fourteenth century under the patronage of the Vijayanagara court. (p. 31)"},

  annotation       = {Summary:A provocative contribution to the history of early modern Euro-Asian interactions that provides new perspectives on the encounter between Catholicism and Hinduism in India. By focusing on the Jesuit missionary's discovery of Indian ``pagan" Hinduism, Zupanov traces the stages of the Jesuit's disconcerting journey into religious relativism or accommodation. At every point of this Euro-Asian encounter, the emerging Catholic communities attempted to twist and turn their own received religion to fit their various collective and/or individual interests. This turning or ``troping" of the Jesuit message into pre-Christian modes of religious expression produced the ``tropics" of the title. Drawing upon a variety of sources in Portuguese, Italian, Spanish, Latin and Tamil, ``Missionary Tropics" documents the construction of the Indian vernacular Catholicism or ``Tropical Catholicism" through a complex layering of missionary religious and social intentions and indigenous responses. By following Galenic humoral medical theory, the Catholic missionaries defined paganism as a natural outgrowth of the hot and humid climate. Reflecting the complex layering of the missionaries' religious and social intentions and the subsequent indigenous responses, this book should be of interest to all those who study religious encounters and are interested in the issues of religious conversion in the early modern world, in India, and elsewhere.},

Since the publication of his first important articles some two decades ago, debate has continued to develop over his distinctive contributions to contemporary political philosophy, the history of political theory, the philosophy of social science, and the discussion of interpretation and hermeneutics across the humanities and social sciences. Nevertheless, his most valuable essays and the best critical articles concerning his work have been scattered in various journals and difficult to obtain. Meaning and Context includes five of the most widely discussed articles by Skinner, which present his approach to the study of political thought and the interpretation of texts. Following these are seven articles by his critics, five of these drawn from earlier publications and two, by John Keane and Charles Taylor, written especially for this volume. Finally, there appears a fifty-seven page reply by Skinner--a major new statement in which he defends and reformulates his method and lays out new lines of research. The editorial introduction provides a systematic overview of the evolution of Skinner's work and of the main reactions to it.</p><p>Besides James Tully, John Keane, and Charles Taylor, the contributors include Joseph V. Femia, Keith Graham, Martin Hollis, Kenneth Minogue, and Nathan Tarcov.</p>}},

  explored here is the human body's relationship to the divine, to the bestial and to
  the machines that imitate or simulate it. The second approach covers the various
  junctures between the body's "outside" and "inside": it can therefore be called a
  "psychosomatic" approach, studying the manifestation - or production - of soul and
  the expression of emotions through the body's attitudes, and, on another level, the
  speculations inspired by cenesthesia, pain and death. Finally, the third approach
  \ldots  brings into play the classical opposition between organ and function by
  showing how a certain organ or bodily substance can be used to justify or challenge
  the way human society functions \ldots " - foreword Part 3.},

Summary:The wide interest in missionary history and source materials is a notable feature of current modern historical scholarship. Hitherto such sources have been regarded as impossibly "tainted", too dominated by religious zeal to provide worthwhile information or objective insights. Now they are being appreciated by scholars from a wide range of disciplinary and intellectual backgrounds. The present volume brings together scholars and archivists with a wide experience of missionary materials in order to show the exceptional wealth of missionary archives and the major contributions they can make not only to the study of the processes of Christian envangelism and Western imperialism in Africa and Asia in the 19th and early 20th centuries, but also their value in documenting and analyzing the nature of Western encounters with indigenous societies and the light which these sources can shed on African and Asian societies},

It also traces the transformation of childbirth in these cultures under the impact of Western biomedical technology, national and international health policies and the wider factors of social and economic change.
  The authors ask what can be done to improve the high rates of
  maternal and infant deaths and illnesses still associated with childbirth in most societies in this area and whether the wholesale replacement of indigenous knowledge by Western biomedical technology is necessarily a good thing.},

Long View on Amazon Pamela O. Long’s clear, accessible, and elegantly written recent book explores the ways that artisan/practitioners influenced the development of the new sciences in the years between 1400 and 1600. Artisan/Practitioners and the Rise of the New Sciences, 1400-1600 (Oregon State University Press, 2011) introduces the notion of a “trading zone,” building on the articulation of the concept in anthropology and in the work of Peter Galison, to explain the gradual breaking-down of the distinction between learned scholars and artist/practitioners as distinct and coherent entities in early modern Europe. Several kinds of trading zones, from the Vitruvian tradition to the physical spaces of arsenals and the city of Rome, provided common ground on which both practitioners and university-educated men came together to share ideas about substantive issues. As a result of this interchange, Long argues, empirical values that had been intrinsic to artisanal work came to be embedded more broadly in European culture, and categories that had initially been bifurcated (like art and nature) became more interchangeable. Long guides readers from a historiographical account of the idea of artisanal influence on the new sciences as it has emerged and developed since the 1920s, and through a series of engaging chapters that introduce works and figures that are crucial to the development of these ideas, including a wonderful account of the architecture of Rome from the pages of Vitruvius through the streets of a city dotted with obelisks and occasionally overcome with waters. Enjoy!},

  abstract             = {{Do civilizations independently invent themselves or are they the result of cultural diffusion? The contributors to this volume do not attempt to provide a definitive answer to this contentious question, one of the most debated issues of the past century. Instead, they shift the focus from theory to reality by presenting empirical evidence on a wide range of cultural phenomena in history and prehistory, thereby demonstrating the processes whereby cultural traits are acquired and modified\--the dynamics of transmission and transformation. <P>The range of topics covered in this volume is of extraordinary breadth. Attention is paid to biological organisms at the cellular level on the one hand and to developments spanning an entire continent on the other. Victor H. Mair traces the distribution of belt hooks and belts from the steppes to North and Central China. At the other end of Asia, Irene Good shows how textiles were used as a medium of exchange in the third millennium B.C. and explicates their cultural significance. In a chapter on the spread of bronze metallurgy across Asia, Andrew Sherratt documents the means whereby complicated technologies were adapted by distant peoples. Yan Sun clarifies the mechanisms whereby bronze implements were used to convey political messages locally and regionally in East Asia. Using linguistic and philological analyses, Peter B. Golden elucidates the ethnogenesis of the Turks, and Michael Witzel reconstructs the complex interrelationships among migratory and settled peoples in western Central Asia during the Bronze Age. Through an inspection of dozens of images and a close reading of textual sources, Elfriede R. Knauer determines the origins of the Chinese goddess known as Queen Mother of the West, an enigma that has puzzled scholars for more than a century. In another piece of trans-Eurasian investigation, Thomas Allsen provides an account of hunting with trained cheetahs. Extending their purview beyond Europe and Asia, John Sorenson and Carl Johannssen use abundant botanical and zoological evidence to affirm that the Old World and the New World must have been in contact long before the fifteenth century. Rounding out the volume is a survey of the problem of modernocentrism by Jerry H. Bentley, in which he provides numerous instances of a globally intertwined past that is not so different from the human present as often imagined. <P>Together these essays constitute a fresh, new look at the way early societies were intimately interrelated. The results of the research presented here show unmistakably that, just as they do today, human beings in antiquity found it natural to share their cultures far and wide. Employing an impressive battery of disciplinary approaches (history, archaeology, art history, linguistics, philology, biology, anthropology), the contributors have created a picture of the human past that is certain to stimulate future research.}},

The twenty-two contributors ask how traditional concepts of nature in the classical texts might inspire or impede an eco-friendly attitude among modern Hindus, and they describe some grassroots approaches to environmental protection. They look to Gandhian principles of minimal consumption, self-reliance, simplicity, and sustainability. And they explore forests and sacred groves in text and tradition and review the political and religious controversies surrounding India’s sacred river systems.},

Patrick Olivelle has collected and edited the best papers to emerge from the conference. Part I of the book looks at what can be construed from archeological evidence. Part II concerns itself with the textual evidence for the period. Taken together, these essays offer an unprecedented look at Indian culture and society in this distant epoch.

The second is an outline of the first. two drawings, one of Vāgbhaṭa, and the other of the commentator Candranandana. The author of the work is Che rje. The work formed the basis for part of the history of medicine written by Sangs rgyas rgya mtsho. The latter author gave us a brief notice of the life and writings of Che rje. The Ah. was translated into Tibetan by Lo chen Rin chen bzang po and the Kashmiri Janārdana in AD 1015 (p.311). The tr. was done at Tho ling (Tholing monastery). The present historical work was composed in AD 1204. The main point Martin ends with is that the rGyud bzhi, 4 tantras, is heavily indebted to the Ah., perhaps more than even the studies of Emmerick 1977 etc. show. Che rje's work divides the Ah into four tantras, but doesn't know the rGyud bzhi. There are more MSS of Che rje's work around and it deserves to be edited and published},

  summary          = {Today yoga is a thoroughly globalised phenomenon. Yoga has taken the world by storm and is even seeing renewed popularity in India. Both in India and abroad, adults, children and teenagers are practicing yoga in diverse settings including: gyms; schools; home; work; yoga studios; and, temples. The yoga diaspora began well over a hundred years ago and we continue to see new manifestations and uses of Yoga in the modern world. As the first of its kind this collection draws together cutting edge scholarship in the field, focusing on the theory and practice of yoga in contemporary times. Offering a range of perspectives on yoga's contemporary manifestations, it maps the movement, development and consolidation of yoga in global settings. This collection features some of the most well-known authors within the field and newer voices. The contributions span a number of disciplines in the humanities, including, anthropology, Philosophy, Studies in Religion and Asian studies, offering a range of entry points to the issues involved in the study of the subject. As such, is of use to those involved in academic scholarship, as well as to the growing number of yoga practitioners who seek a deeper account of the origin and significance of the techniques and traditions they are engaging with. It will also - and perhaps most of all - speak to the growing numbers of 'scholar-practitioners' who straddle these two realms.},

  annotation       = {Catalogue of a NY exhibition. p.66 (P. Pal): The earliest sites that have yielded terra-cotta objects, which, according to tradition, go back to the Kushan period, are Semthan, Harwan, Hutmora, Ushkur, and recently Kutbal. These sites are particularly noteworthy because of the large, stamped tiles with figural and symbolic forms that represent an independent local artistic tradition. Although tiles for paving floors and walls of monasteries were used in Gandhara, they are not as richly and diversely decorated as those from Kashmir. The figures in the Harwan tiles further show both Indian and foreign ethnic types, strange crouching ascetics unique in the Indian plastic tradition and convincingly rendered flora and fauna. Both the Harwan and the Kutbal finds reflext a mature and confident state of artistic skill but, strangely, the tradition did not continue. There is no certainty about the exact dates of these sites, although the consensus is between the third and the fifth century. (p. 66)},

  abstract  = {This volume is a facsimile edition of two ancient Sanskrit manuscripts from Tibet, which were actually used by Indian acaryas and Tibetan lotsavas for translation into Tibetan. They are valuble for the comments of the lotsavas written in the cursive Tibetan script dbu.med on the palmeaves themselves. The two texts are: (i) Vimalaprabha commentary on the Kalacakra-tantra, and (ii) Pancaraksa. The script of the manuscript of Vimalaprabha shows that it was written in Magadha and belongs to the early 11th century. It is the earliest manuscript of the Vimalaprabha. Jagannath Upadhyaya, Vrajavallabh Dvivedi and S.S. Bahulkar edited the commentary and original Tantra in 1986-1994 from the Central Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies, Sarnath. They used six manuscripts, three of them in Devanagari script, two in Newari script, and one in old Bengali script. The present manuscript is the oldest of them, and merits a new edition. The five texts of the PANCARAKSA have been treated as separate titles in the Kanjur (Toh. 558, 559, 561, 562, 563). They were translated by Ye.ses.sde with the help of Silendrabodhi, Jnanasiddhi, Sakyaprabha, Jinamitra and Danasila, during the reign of Ral.pal.can who ruled from 817 to 836. It was a period of great literary activity, when a common terminology was developed by a royal commission with eminent Indian and Tibetan scholars for the translation of complex philosophic ideas. The outcome of this historic effort was the Mahavyutpatti, which is an astounding linguistic work of transforming a primal Tibetan language into a valid literary language of Classical sophistication. The Sanskrit manuscript of the Five Raksa texts reproduced here should go back to the early ninth century. It is a glorious symbol of the foundations of the literary heritage of Tibet.

Thematically divided into three parts, the first to pillars and rocks, which bear his inscriptions. The second part examines the interconnectedness of the edicts, their monumentality, and the different concept of kingship they conveyed. The third part analyses the making of the cultural memory of Asoka and raises pertinent questions crucial for understanding the relationship between the past and the present. The essays outline the importance of Asoka not only for the Indian nation-state but also for the entire Buddhist world of South and South-east Asia. Moving away from conventional periodization of Indian history, it raises important questions on the beginning of history and archaeology in the modern period. The book examines the extent to which nineteenth century initiatives have affected the study of Asoka and his reign. This book will be important for scholars and students of ancient Indian history, particularly those concerned with Asoka and the Mauryas. It will also interest archaeologists and scholars of Buddhist studies. Readership: This book will be important for scholars and students of ancient Indian history, particularly those concerned with Asoka and the Mauryas.

  abstract         = {This book demarcates and records subaltern therapy as a distinct realm that both interacts with and resists statist medicine. It provides a more integrated approach that places the subaltern subject and subaltern therapy in an ongoing and historical relationship with state-sanctioned and elite forms of medical practice. Focusing on those who exist and practice in the shadow of statist medicine, examining how they operate, and how they experience being in this position, it offers a means to understand how subaltern practice has evolved and changed over time, and how it has related in ever-changing ways to other forms of medicine and healing. The result shows that there is considerable fluidity in this, so that a type of practice may be elite in one context, subaltern in another. Contributors examine statist medicine from a critical perspective, the forms that subaltern therapy assumes, and their logics, as well as the problem of transition, one of the central concerns of subaltern historiography. Finally, other forms of diverse therapeutic practice are discussed, which continue to enjoy mass popular support in South Asia to this day. Addresses an area of research that is expanding rapidly among anthropologists and historians today and including contributions by some of the leading figures in South Asian history, this book is a path-breaking contribution to the study of medicine and society, history and South Asian Studies},

Nevertheless, though India is nowadays a part of our daily media environment, its science, as ancient as Greek science, is still badly known and insufficiently included in history of science manuals. This book aims at helping to fill this gap by letting some of the best specialists in Indian astronomy and mathematics express themselves. They recount the evolution of these sciences, from the Aryabhatiya (6th century) to the works of the Keralese astronomers-mathematicians (13-16th centuries), via treatises on prosody (14th century) and on astrolabe making produced since the same period.

  abstract         = {The Yogācārabhūmi, a fourth-century Sanskrit treatise, is the largest Indian text on Buddhist meditation. Its enormous scope exhaustively encompasses all yoga instructions on the disciplines and contemplative exercises of śrāvaka, pratyekabuddha, and bodhisattva practitioners. The thoroughness of the text meant that the Yogācārabhūmi became the fundamental source for later Buddhist writings on meditation across Asia. The present edited volume, conceived by Geumgang University in South Korea, brings together the scholarship of thirty-four leading Buddhist specialists on the Yogācārabhūmi from across the globe. The essays elaborate the background and environment in which the Yogācārabhūmi was composed and redacted, provide a detailed summary of the work, raise fundamental and critical issues about the text, and reveal its reception history in India, China, and Tibet. The volume also provides a thorough survey of contemporary Western and Asian scholarship on the Yogācārabhūmi in particular and the Yogācāra tradition more broadly. The Foundation for Yoga Practitioners aims not only to tie together the massive research on this text that has been carried out in Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan, Europe, and the United States up to now, but also to make this scholarship accessible to all students and scholars of Buddhism.},

  abstract  = {At the beginning of the 21st century, alcoholism, transnational drug trafficking and drug addiction constitute major problems in various South Asian countries. The production, circulation and consumption of intoxicating substances created (and responded to) social upheavals in the region and had widespread economic, political and cultural repercussions on an international level. This book looks at the cultural, social, and economic history of intoxicants in South Asia, and analyses the role that alcohol and drugs have played in the region.

The book explores the linkages between changing meanings of intoxicating substances, the making of and contestations over colonial and national regimes of regulation, economics, and practices and experiences of consumption. It shows the development of current meanings of intoxicants in South Asia – in terms of politics, cultural norms and identity formation – and the way in which the history of drugs and alcohol is enmeshed in the history of modern empires and nation states — even in a country in which a staunch teetotaller and active anti-drug crusader like Mohandas Gandhi is presented as the ‘father of the nation’.

Primarily a historical analysis, the book also includes perspectives from Modern Indology and Cultural Anthropology and situates developments in South Asia in wider imperial and global contexts. It is of interest to scholars working on the social and cultural history of alcohol and drugs, South Asian Studies and Global History.},

  abstract  = {While European manuscripts have been the subject of numerous historical, philological, and art historical studies over the past three decades, the study of the material culture of Asian (Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic, Taoist, and the like) manuscript traditions remains a relatively unexplored field. But Asian manuscripts, as the contributors to From Mulberry Leaves to Silk Scrolls demonstrate, contain much more than the semantic meaning of the words they reproduce. The ten essays collected here look closely at a wide variety of manuscript traditions with a special focus on both their history and the ways in they can be studied through digital technology to make the cataloguing, comparative analysis, and aesthetic appreciation of them more accessible to scholars and students.

Each essay examines ways in which hand-produced texts—from ancient to early modern Thai, Pali, Chinese, Central Asian, Sanskrit, and Arabic manuscript traditions—shape both meaning and interpretation, and to a larger extent, the cultural norms that define their use. Together, the essays explore topics such as the best current practices for preservation and cataloging, the value of collaboration among scholars who work on different aspects of codicological, paleographic, orthographic, and material culture studies, and the use of these material objects for religious, political, cultural and pedagogical purposes. From Mulberry Leaves to Silk Scrolls explores issues relating to the complex relationships between text and image and between the spoken and the written word, and among the overlapping realms of religion, science, and society.

  abstract  = {Plant life has figured prominently in Indian culture. Archaeobotanical findings and Vedic texts confirm that plants have been central not only as a commodity (sources of food; materia medica; sacrificial matter; etc.) but also as powerful and enduring symbols. Roots of Wisdom, Branches of Devotion: Plant Life in South Asian Traditions explores how herbs, trees, shrubs, flowers and vegetables have been studied, classified, represented and discussed in a variety of Indian traditions such as Vedism, Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, indigenous cultures and Islam. Moving from an analysis of the sentience of plants in early Indian philosophies and scientific literature, the various chapters, divided in four thematic sections, explore Indian flora within devotional and mystic literature (bhakti and Sufism), mythological, ritual and sacrificial culture, folklore, medicine, perfumery, botany, floriculture and agriculture. Arboreal and floral motifs are also discussed as an expression of Indian aesthetics since early coinage to figurative arts and literary figures. Finally, the volume reflects current discourses on environmentalism and ecology as well as on the place of indigenous flora as part of an ancient yet still very much alive sacred geography.},

This collection of essays gives a comparative overview of vaccination at different times, in widely different places and under different types of political regime. Core themes in the chapters include immunisation as an element of state formation; citizens' articulation of seeing (or not seeing) their needs incorporated into public health practice; allegations that donors of development aid have too much influence on third-world health policies; and an ideological shift that regards vaccines more as profitable commodities than as essential tools of public health.

  abstract  = {The historical interface between science and religion was depicted as an unbridgeable conflict in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. Starting in the 1970s, such a conception was too simplistic and not at all accurate when considering the totality of that relationship. This volume evaluates the utility of the "complexity principle" in past, present, and future scholarship. First put forward by historian John Brooke over twenty-five years ago, the complexity principle rejects the idea of a single thesis of conflict or harmony, or integration or separation, between science and religion.Rethinking History, Science, and Religion brings together an interdisciplinary group of scholars at the forefront of their fields to consider whether new approaches to the study of science and culture-such as recent developments in research on science and the history of publishing, the global history of science, the geographical examination of space and place, and science and media-have cast doubt on the complexity thesis, or if it remains a serviceable historiographical model.},

The resulting proximity and juxtaposition of previously distant contents, challenge previous knowledge and trigger further developments.

With a vast selection of highly representative case studies – from India, Islamic Asia and Spain to Ethiopian cultures, from Ancient Christian to Coptic, and Medieval European domains – this volume deals with manuscripts planned or growing and resulting in time to comprise ‘more than one’. Whatever their contents – the natural world and related recipes, astronomical tables or personal notes, documentary, religious and even highly revered holy texts – codicological and textual features of these manuscripts reveal how similar needs received different answers in varying contexts and times.},
